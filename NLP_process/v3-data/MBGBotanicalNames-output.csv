","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Grindelia lanceolata, commonly called gum plant, narrow-leaved gumweed, or spiny-toothed gumweed, is a biennial to short-lived perennial wildflower that is native to limestone glades, rocky prairies and bald knobs from Tennessee to Missouri to Kansas south to Texas and Alabama. Original native range has expanded over time to now also include fallow fields, railroad right-of-ways, roadsides and waste ground (Steyermark). Plants may also be found in Connecticut, Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio and Wisconsin where they were probably introduced. Gum plant typically grows to 2-3' tall on stems clad with alternate, narrow, lanceolate leaves (to 4"" long) armed with bristle-tipped marginal teeth. Daisy-like flowers (to 1.25"" diameter) with bright yellow rays surrounding yellow center disks bloom from June to September. Each flower is subtended by resinous, loosely spreading to ascending, involucre bracts which are slightly sticky (hence the common name of gum plant or gumweed).Genus name honors Latvian pharmacist, chemist, physician and botanist David Hieronymus Grindel (1776-1836).Specific epithet is in reference to the lance-shaped leaves.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Root rot may occur in poorly drained soils. Watch for scale and mealybugs.
","
Garden Uses
Wildflower gardens, cottage gardens, wild areas, prairies or glades. Borders.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Guazuma ulmifolia, commonly called West Indian elm, is a medium-sized broadleaf evergreen tree that typically matures to 30-60' tall with a rounded crown.  It is native to tropical areas in the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America and South America.  Oblique, acuminate, hairy, ovate to lance-shaped leaves (2-4"" long) are scabrous above and velvety below.  Leaves are evergreen, except some leaf drop normally occurs in climates with dry seasons.  Tiny, mildly fragrant, pale yellow flowers (to 1/4"" diameter) appear in many-flowered, axillary or terminal cymes.  Peak bloom time varies with geographical location, but generally trees will sporadically flower throughout much of the year.  Flowers are followed by blackish, warty, rounded to oblong fruit capsules (each to 1 1/2"" long) which resemble mulberries.  Fruits contain a very small amount of edible pulp.  

Synonymous with and formerly known as Theobroma guazuma.Specific epithet comes from the Latin words ulmus meaning elm and folia meaning leaf in reference to the elm-like leaves.
","
Problems
No serious insect of disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Shade tree for landscapes.  In native habitats, practical uses include (1) wood is used for a variety of purposes including posts,  crates, construction, and carpentry, (2) foliage is a fodder source for livestock, (3) medicinal applications for treatment of a wide variety of medical impairments and (4)  seeds are edible.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zone 7 where it is best grown in fertile, humus-rich, consistently moist to boggy soils in part shade.  Leaves often becomes stressed in full sun locations. Soils must never be allowed to dry out.  Plants are intolerant of extreme heat of cold.  They rarely succeed in hot or dry climates.  Remove damaged or dead leaves as they appear.  In the northern parts of this plant's growing range, plants should be sited in protected areas sheltered from drying winds and given a substantial dry winter mulch.  North of USDA Zone 7,  plants are not considered to be winter hardy.  Bare roots should be lifted before the first fall frost for storage in cool areas (40 degrees F.) in a dry medium such as peat or vermiculite.  Bare roots may be replanted outside in spring after last spring frost date.  Plants may also be grown in containers that are moved inside to a cool, frost-free location such as an unheated garage where they will go dormant for winter.  Apply minimal moisture to the soil every 10 days.  Plants may be propagated by division or seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gunnera manicata, commonly called giant rhubarb, is one of the largest herbaceous perennials on earth, typically growing in a rounded clump to as much as 10' tall and to 14' wide.  It is native to southern Brazil and Columbia.  Huge, puckered, toothed, palmately-lobed, prominently-veined leaves (to 6-8' across) with rounded to reniform (kidney-shaped) blades are borne on stiff, prickly, reddish-hairy stalks to 8' long.  Leaves are peltate, tilting to the horizontal.  These dinosaur-sized leaves give rise to the additional common name of dinosaur food for this plant.  Tiny, reddish-green flowers in thick, club-like spikes (3-6' conical panicles) rise up from the crown in early summer.  Flower spikes are often somewhat hidden by the foliage.  Flowers give way to reddish-green fruits (tiny berry-like drupes).  Although botanically unrelated to rhubarb, the coarsely-textured leaves of this gunnera are considered by some to be reminiscent of the leaves of rhubarb.Genus name honors Johan Ernst Gunnerus (1718-1773), Norwegian bishop (at Trondheim) and botanist, the author of Flora Norvegica (1766-1772).Specific epithet means with long sleeves.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.   Watch for slugs and scale.
","
Garden Uses
Primarily grown for its gigantic leaves, but the flower spikes are also attractive.  Wet areas of the landscape.  Water gardens.  Pond peripheries.  Bog gardens.

Culture
Guzmania or vase plant is a bromeliad. Bromeliads are either epiphytic or terrestrial. Guzmania is an epiphyte. Epiphytic plants do not live in soil but survive by clinging to a tree or other supports such as rocks. Epiphytes obtain all their water and mineral needs from the air. Guzmania need bright, but indirect light and warm temperatures to grow well. Temperatures should be a minimum of 60°F at night. Water your plants well and then allow the soil to dry before watering again. Guzmania are prone to root rots if the soil is kept wet. Proper drainage is essential. The soil mix must be porous enough to allow water to drain off quickly, but should never be soggy, and allow air to reach the roots. Keep water in the cup at the center of the plant, especially during the summer months. Plant should be kept drier during the cooler or winter months. The plants also need humid air to prosper. Use a diluted fertilizer of half-strength or less.

After flowering the parent plant dies. Offshoots, or pups, provide for the steady renewal of the plant.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Guzmania lingulata, commonly called vase plant, has foliage 18 inches long. The green leaves, sometimes with dark crossbands, form a funnel-shaped rosette. The flower stem is usually shorter than the leaves. The flowerhead is globular with up to 50 flowers with white petals nestling in a bed of large red to pink bracts. The flowers often last 2 to 4 months.Genus name honors Anastasio Guzman, an 18th-century Spanish naturalist.Specific epithet means strap-like.
","
Problems
Potential problems are leaf spots, scales, spider mites, and mealybugs. Keeping the air humid enough for successful growth could also be a problem in a home environment. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
Used very successfully in indoor commercial situations such as shopping malls and office buildings. Guzmania do well in low light conditions and artificial light. They also hold their color for an extended time making them ideal for indoor pot culture.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12. In St. Louis, grow as a houseplant in sunny locations with protection from direct afternoon sun. Bright light with filtered sun is needed for best foliage color. Soil based potting mix. Keep soils evenly moist, with slight reduction in watering from fall to late winter. Many gardeners remove flowers as they appear because of their unpleasant smell and clean up problems. Pinch growing tips to prevent legginess. Easily propagated from cuttings.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gynura aurantiaca, commonly called velvet plant or purple velvet plant, is native to Java. It is a woody-based evergreen perennial that is noted for its velvety, purple-haired foliage. In its native habitat, it will grow to 2’ tall and spread to 4’ wide over time. Coarsely-toothed, ovate to elliptic, green leaves (to 8” long) are covered with reddish-purple hairs. Weak stems are initially erect but tend to sprawl with time. Clusters (corymbs) of tiny, senecio-like, discoid, orange-yellow flowers appear in winter. Flowers generally do not appear when plants are grown in lower light. ‘Purple Passion’ (purple passion vine) is a decumbent cultivar featuring trailing or twining stems.Genus name comes from the Greek words gyne meaning female and oura meaning a tail for the long rough stigma of the flower.Specific epithet means orange-colored.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for aphids, whitefly, mealybugs, spider mites or scale. Overwatering may cause rots. Greenish foliage may indicate light levels are too low. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
Best in hanging baskets in sunny areas of the home.

Culture
Grow in average, somewhat dry, well-drained soils in full sun. Prefers alkaline soils (pH7.0 to 7.5). Add lime to acidic soils. Soils must have good drainage. Plants may not survive winter in wet, poorly drained soils. Likes to be left undisturbed once established. Cut back or shear after flowering to promote rebloom.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Gypsophila paniculata, commonly called baby's breath, is a mainstay filler plant of the floral industry. Sprays of baby's breath are frequently used as filler in bouquets and floral arrangements.Genus name comes from the Greek gypos meaning gypsum and philos meaning friendship in reference to this plant’s preference for high pH soils.Specific epithet refers to the flowers being arranged in panicles.'Bristol Fairy' is a diffusely branched, mound-forming cultivar that features numerous, long-lasting, double white flowers (1/4"" wide) in open, airy panicles on wiry, jointed stems in summer. Lance-shaped foliage is somewhat sparse.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Some susceptibility to botrytis and aster yellows. May need staking or other support.
","
Garden Uses
Provides excellent contrast and texture to the perennial border. May be used as summer filler to cover areas once occupied by early spring wildflowers, bulbs or other plants which disappear into dormancy by early summer.

Culture
Best grown in humusy, consistently moist, well-drained soils in part shade. Tolerates close to full shade, particularly in the hot summer climates of the deep South. Best growth occurs in climates with cool summer temperatures. Hardy in Zones 5-9. Plant foliage will burn in full sun locations and lose color intensity (particularly on variegated leaf cultivars) in full shade. Clumps spread by rhizomes, but are not considered to be invasive. Mulch in winter.  Trim foliage to the ground in late winter to early spring before the new shoots emerge.  Propagation is easiest by division. Species plants (not cultivars thereof) may be grown by seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hakonechloa macra, commonly called Japanese forest grass or Hakone grass, is a rhizomatous, shade-loving, deciduous perennial grass that is native both to moist mountain areas including wet rocky cliffs and to moist woodland areas in central Japan, including areas around Mt. Hakone from which both its genus name and common name are derived.  Other common names include forest grass and Japanese forest grass.  Gracefully arching, linear-lanceolate, bright green leaves (to 10"" long and 3/8"" wide) form dense, spreading, cascading mounds to 12-18"" tall and to 24"" wide.  Leaves have a papery texture resembling the leaves of some types of bamboo.Genus name comes from the Japanese place named Hakone and the Greek word chloa meaning a grass.Specific epithet means large.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Root heaving can be a problem in winter.  Leaves may scorch in hot summers, particularly when consistent moisture is not maintained. Deer tend to avoid this plant.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent spreading ornamental grass for shady locations.  Shade groundcover or accent for woodland gardens. Shaded areas of mixed borders.  Along paths and walks. Rock gardens.  Slopes.  Sprawl over rocks.  Containers.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Halesia carolina, native the Southeast U.S., is a small understory tree with a broad, rounded crown or a large shrub. In the wild, Carolina silverbell typically does not exceed 35' in height (though specimens have been found in the 80-100' range), and is frequently shrubby in habit. Features drooping clusters (usually 2-5 flowers each) of bell-shaped, white flowers (1/2"") which appear in April shortly before or simultaneous to the point when the leaves emerge. Four-winged, brownish, nut-like fruits appear in the fall and often persist well into the winter. Dull, finely toothed, dark yellowish-green, ovate-oblong leaves (2-5"" long) turn a somewhat attractive yellow in fall, but may drop rather early. Synonymous with Halesia tetraptera (tetraptera meaning four-winged).Genus name honors the Reverend Stephen Hales (1677-1761), English physiologist, chemist, and inventor.Specific epithet means of North or South Carolina.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Susceptible to chlorosis in high pH soils.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Best flowering is in full sun.  Prefers moist, acidic, organically rich soils.  Consistent moisture is best (leaf scorch may occur during periods of summer drought).  Shrubs have some tolerance for clay soils as long as drainage is good.  Promptly remove root suckers to prevent colonial spread.  It is particularly important to remove root suckers rising from below a graft union.  Prune in spring after flowering to control shape and size.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hamamelis vernalis, commonly called Ozark witch hazel, is native to the Ozark Plateau extending from southern Missouri through northwestern Arkansas to eastern Oklahoma.  In Missouri, it is typically found in gravelly stream beds, bases of rocky slopes along streams and less frequently in rocky wooded hillsides where it spreads by suckers to form large colonies (Steyermark).  It typically grows to 6' tall.  Flowers in axillary clusters appear in mid to late winter (January-March in St. Louis) prior to the emergence of the foliage in a variety of colors ranging from pale yellow to dark reddish purple.  Each flower has four, narrow, ribbon-like, curled and crinkled petals (each to only 1/3"" long) that are usually red at the base transitioning to copper orange at the tip.  Calyx cup is dull red.  Ovate-rounded leaves (to 3” long) emerge light green with reddish-bronze tints in spring, but quickly mature to medium to dark green.  Golden yellow fall color.  Fruit is a non-showy dehiscent capsule which splits open in September-October to release its seeds.Genus name comes from the Greek words hama meaning at same time and melon meaning apple or fruit in reference to the occurrence of both fruit and flowers at the same time on this shrub (particularly in the case of fall flowering members of the genus).Specific epithet from Latin means spring in reference to the flower bloom.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Caterpillars and Japanese beetles may chew on the leaves.  Watch for leaf gall aphids, weevils, scale, leafroller and leafminer.  Potential diseases include powdery mildew, occasional leaf spots and rots.
","
Garden Uses
Superior winter-flowering shrub for the landscape.  Shrub borders, woodland gardens.  Screen or tall hedge.  Good specimen.

Promptly remove suckers to prevent colonial spread.  Little pruning is required.  Prune in early spring if necessary.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hamamelis virginiana, known as common witch hazel, is a fall-blooming, deciduous shrub or small tree that is native to woodlands, forest margins and stream banks in eastern North America.  It typically grows 15-20’ tall with a similar spread in cultivation, but can reach 30’ tall in its native habitat.  Stem-hugging clusters of fragrant bright yellow flowers, each with four crinkly, ribbon-shaped petals, appear along the branches from October to December, usually after leaf drop but sometimes at the time of fall color.  Fertilized flowers will form fruit over a long period extending through winter and into the following growing season.  Fruits are greenish seed capsules that become woody with age and mature to light brown.  Each seed capsule splits open in fall of the following year, exploding the 1-2 black seeds within for up to 30 feet.  Oval to obovate, medium to dark green leaves (to 6” long) with dentate to wavy margins turn quality shades of yellow in fall. Plants of this species are usually the last native flowering plants to bloom in Missouri each year.Genus name comes from the Greek words hama meaning at same time and melon meaning apple or fruit in reference to the occurrence of both fruit and flowers at the same time on this shrub (particularly in the case of fall flowering members of the genus).Specific epithet means from Virginia.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Occasional insect galls (small wasps) appear on the foliage. Japanese beetles may chew on the leaves in some areas.
","

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-10. In St. Louis, it is usually grown as an annual. Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Good soil drainage is important for this plant. When grown as an annual, this plant may be sited directly in the soil or in containers that can be overwintered indoors. Although somewhat drought-tolerant once established as a perennial in southern areas, it prefers regular moisture when grown as an annual. Best flowering is in full sun conditions. Thrives in high heat.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hamelia patens, commonly called scarlet bush or Texas firebush, is native to Southern Florida, Mexico, Central and South America. It is also commonly known as Mexican firecracker or firecracker shrub because of the similarity of its flowers to firecrackers. Where this shrub may be grown as a perennial, it is evergreen, will rise to as much as 10-15’ tall and will bloom year-round. As an annual in the St. Louis area, it typically rises to 2-3’ tall in a growing season and blooms in summer and early fall. Tubular orange-red to red flowers appear in terminal clusters (cymes) in summer and fall. Whorls of pointed, oval, gray-green leaves (to 6” long) with pinkish veins. Leaves turn red in fall. Reddish stems and leafstalks. Flowers give way to small dark fruits. Butterflies and hummingbirds are reportedly attracted to the flowers, and birds enjoy the fruits.Genus name honors Henri Louis du Hamel du Monceau (1700-1781), celebrated French writer on trees and shrubs.Specific epithet means spreading.

Culture
Best grown in moist to wet soil conditions in full sun to light shade.  Plants can spread aggressively in garden areas by rhizomes and self-seeding under optimum conditions.  Preferred habitats for this plant are in moist ground at the edges of rivers or streams.  It is relatively tolerant of light shade and grows well in rich floodplain forests, thickets or openings.  Some authorities consider this species to be an obligate wetland species.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hasteola suaveolens, commonly known as sweet Indian plantain, is an herbaceous perennial of the aster/composite family that typically grows to 3-5’ tall, but occasionally to 7’ tall or more.  It is native to moist to wet soils along riverbanks, river floodplains, wet meadows along streams, marsh peripheries, and moist low woods from Connecticut to southeastern Minnesota south to Missouri, Tennessee, Maryland and in the mountains to Georgia.  Plants have shallow, coarsely fibrous root systems.

Sweet Indian plantain is unbranched below the flower clusters.  Lower leaves are arrowhead-shaped (hastate) to triangular (deltate) with saw-toothed margins.  Each lower leaf grows to 15” long and to 7” wide.  Upper leaves are more deltate to lanceolate in shape, becoming much smaller in size as they ascend the stem.  Flowers in flat-topped clusters (corymbs) bloom from July to September.  Flowers are creamy white but rarely pinkish.  Each flowerhead has 25-30 creamy white to pinkish disk flowers (no rays).  The base of each flowerhead is surrounded by linear phyllaries (floral bracts).   Fertile disk florets are followed by achenes with tufts of white or tawny hair.  Seeds are distributed by the wind or sometimes by water. 

Sweet Indian plantain is uncommonly found throughout much of its range in the U.S. Populations of this plant have declined to low levels in many areas of its native range because of habitat loss (wetland reduction).  Draining and filling of wetlands has in many regions contributed to a significant decline of this species which is in large part dependent upon riverine habitats.  It is currently listed as an endangered species in Connecticut, New York, Maryland and Minnesota.  It is listed as a threatened species in several other States.   

Cacalia suaveolens and Synosma suaveolens are synonyms.Genus name means hastate in reference to its hastate lower leaves.Specific epithet means sweet-scented.Notwithstanding the plantain part of its common name, sweet indian plantain is totally unrelated to the weedy plantain (Plantago major) which has naturalized over time throughout the U.S. as a somewhat uncontrollable lawn weed.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in part shade to full shade. Trim plants in early spring to control growth and maintain attractive appearance. For ground covers, large areas may if necessary be mowed with a rotary mower on a high setting. Not reliably winter hardy in the St. Louis area where it appreciates a winter mulch and a protected location.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hedera colchica, commonly called Persian ivy, is an evergreen woody vine or ground cover which produces the largest  leaves (4-10"" long) of any of the ivies. The leaves are leathery, slightly toothed, heart-shaped, deep green and curl at the edges giving a slightly wilted appearance. As a vertical vine, stems will climb and adhere to most surfaces by aerial rootlets, typically growing to 10-15' tall in 5 years, but if not pruned can eventually reach 30-50'. As a ground cover, stems root as they spread outward. Adult forms produce panicles of greenish white flowers that are insignificant but attractive to bees. Its globular black fruits are eaten by birds.Genus name is the Latin name for ivy.Specific epithet refers to Colchis the name for a region in the Southern Caucasus on the eastern coast of the Black Sea where this plant is native.
","
Problems
Leaf spots and mites can be significant problems. Slugs and snails will sometimes hide and breed in the thick foliage.
","
Garden Uses
Extremely versatile. Forms dense ground cover which will crowd out weeds and other plants. Particularly effective in shady areas where grass will not grow. Good plant to control soil erosion on slopes or hills. Can be grown to cover a variety of vertical structures such as trellises or walls or topiary forms. Variegated forms are also grown in hanging baskets or as a houseplant.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Will also grow in full sun. Tolerates a wide range of soils, but prefers rich loams. Tolerates some drought, but produces best foliage color in evenly moist soils. In the St. Louis area, plants will benefit from a placement that will provide some protection from winter wind and sun and from hot summer temperatures. Plants may be propagated vegetatively or by seed. Birds help disperse seed. Spreading stems will root at the nodes where they touch the soil. Ground covers rarely need pruning except when they invade unintended areas. Ground covers may be trimmed on the edges with a spade or shears.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hedera helix, commonly known as English ivy, is a vigorous, aggressive, fast-growing, woody evergreen perennial that is primarily grown as a climbing vine or trailing ground cover.   As a climbing vine, it  may over time grow upwards to 50-100' in height.  As a ground cover, it typically grows to 6-9"" tall but spreads over time to 50-100'.  English ivy grows in two forms or stages:  (1) juvenile stage is the climbing/spreading stage (most often seen) in which plants produces thick, 3-5 lobed, dark green leaves (to 4” long ) on non-flowering stems with adventitious roots, and (2) adult stage is the shrubby non-climbing stage in which lobeless, elliptic-ovate, dark green leaves appear on rootless stems that do not spread or climb, but do produce round, umbrella-like clusters of greenish-white flowers in early fall followed by blue-black berries. Native to Europe, English ivy was brought to the U. S. by settlers in colonial days.  It has been and continues to be widely sold in the U. S. as an ornamental plant.  It has escaped gardens and naturalized in a large number of eastern, midwestern and pacific coast states.  In some climates such as in the Pacific Northwest, it is considered by some to be an invasive invader of woodland and open areas where it often aggressively displaces native vegetation by densely smothering large areas of ground with its trailing densely-leaved stems or by climbing into tree canopies via clinging aerial rootlets.Genus name is the Latin name for ivy.Specific epithet from Greek means spiral or twisted.
","
Problems
Aphids, mealybugs, caterpillars, loopers and scale may appear.  Watch for leaf spots, canker, bacterial leaf spot, stem rot and powdery mildew.  Mites can be significant problem.  Climbing vines around homes easily crawl into unintended areas, curl around gutters and damage painted surfaces, loose mortar or aluminum siding if growth is not closely monitored. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
Cover for fences, trellises or walls. Ground cover. Lawn alternative. Smaller-leaved cultivars are often used for topiary shapes, hanging baskets, houseplants or small area ground covers.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10. Best grown in organically rich, medium to wet, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Likes hot and humid summers and consistently moist soils. In St. Louis, plant rhizomes in the ground in spring after last frost date. Lift rhizomes in fall and store for winter in slightly moist vermiculite or peat in a cool, dry location. Also may be grown in containers or tubs which should be overwintered indoors in a cool, dry, frost-free location. Containers are best overwintered in greenhouses if available. Containers may be sunk into the ground at the periphery of a water garden or pond.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hedychium coronarium, commonly called white ginger lily or garland flower, is perhaps native to the Himalayas but it has been widely cultivated in tropical Asia. It is a rhizomatous tender perennial that may grow to 10’ tall in its native habitat, but more typically grows 3-6’ tall. Features large, lance-shaped, medium green leaves (to 24” long x 5” wide). Fragrant white flowers in dense elliptical racemes (4-8” long) in late summer to early fall. Individual flowers purportedly resemble butterflies, hence the sometimes used common name of butterfly ginger for this species.Genus name comes from the Greek words hedys meaning sweet and chion meaning snow. The flower of one species is white and fragrant.Specific epithet means pertaining to garlands.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Best in gritty, moderately fertile, alkaline soils. Tolerates poor sandy or rocky soils. Best performance generally occurs in cool summer climates such as the Pacific Northwest. Consider trimming back taller plants after flowering to shape, particularly in hot and humid summer climates such as the St. Louis area where plant stems tend to recline in the heat of the summer. Cut back stems to the ground after frost. Relatively easy to grow from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hedysarum coronarium, commonly called French honeysuckle, sulla or sulla clover, is a bushy, herbaceous perennial or biennial that typically grows to 3’ tall and as wide. It is closely related to lespedeza and vetch. Features gray-green to medium green, odd-pinnate, compound leaves, each with 7-15 elliptic to rounded leaflets. Extremely fragrant, bright red, pea-like flowers bloom in late spring to early summer in dense axillary racemes atop upright flowering stems. Flowers are attractive to bees. Good fresh cut flower. Flowers give way to non-ornamental yellowish seedpods that turn brown as they mature. This plant is sometimes cultivated for hay and livestock fodder in parts of Europe and northern Africa.Genus name comes from the Greek word hedysaron meaning from and hedys meaning sweet.Specific epithet means pertaining to garlands.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Heimia salicifolia, known by a variety of common names including sinicuichi, narrow-leaf heimia, shrubby yellowcrest or sun opener, is a deciduous, densely-branched, flowering shrub of the loosestrife family that grows in the wild to 10’ tall and as wide.  It is native to brushlands and the Rio Grande basin from the far southern tip of Texas south through Mexico and Central America to Argentina.  This is a spreading shrub that features narrow green leaves, a spring to fall bloom of yellow flowers and somewhat attractive reddish stems.  Solitary, short-stalked yellow flowers bloom from the leaf axils.  Each flower (3/4” across) has a campanulate calyx, 5-7 petals, 10-13 stamens and a thin style.  Petals drop soon after the flowers open.  Willow-like, narrow-oblong to linear-lanceolate leaves are to 3.5” long.  Fruits are dry rounded 4-celled capsules containing very tiny seeds.  

Foliage of this shrub has been used medicinally and psychoactively dating back to the time of the Aztecs.  Shamans continue to use this plant today.  Leaves can be used dry or fresh for preparation of a tea (sinicuichi) which reportedly causes euphoric, time/place altered, muscle-relaxed and anti-inflammatory effects.   Dried leaves are sometime smoked in cigarette form.  Sinicuichi usage reportedly causes vision to become yellow tinted, hence the sometimes used common name of sun opener for this shrub.  Notwithstanding some of the bizarre effects reportedly experienced by using sincuichi, this plant may be legally purchased, grown and used as an ornamental or otherwise in all 50 states.Genus name honors Dr. Ernst Ludwig Heim (1747-1834), German physician.Specific epithet comes from Salix  (willow genus) and folia meaning leaves in reference to the willow-like shape of plant leaves.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Helenium amarum, commonly known as bitterweed or sneezeweed, is an upright, aromatic, bushy annual of the composite family that typically grows to 12” tall, but less frequently rises to as much as 24”, on upright, striate stems which are many-branched above.  Stems are clad with alternate, wide-spreading and ascending, linear to linear-filiform, thread-like leaves (to 3” long but less than 1/8” wide) with resinous glands.  Daisy-like flowers (to 3” diameter) bloom from mid/late summer into fall (August-October), with earlier bloom typically occurring in warm winter climates.  Each flower features 5-10 wedge-shaped, golden yellow rays, each ray having three lobes at the tip.  Rays droop downward from a spherical yellow (occasionally brown) center disk containing numerous tiny disk florets.  

This genus is primarily found growing in sandy soils in the southeastern to southcentral U.S. from Virginia to Florida west to Missouri, Kansas and Texas.  However, it has spread over time and naturalized in many of the eastern, central and Great Plains states plus California.  It is currently found in a variety of habitats primarily including disturbed areas, upland prairies, plains, rocky glades, woodland margins, gravelly areas along railroad tracks, roadsides, pastures and sandy/gravelly ground.Genus name comes from the Greek name helenion which is the name of a Greek plant which honors Helen of Troy.  It is unclear as to the relevance of Helen of Troy to the within genus of plants which are exclusively native to North and South America.Specific epithet from Latin means bitter.Common name of bitterweed is in reference to this plant containing a toxic substance which causes milk to taste bitter when cows graze on the foliage.  

Common name of sneezeweed is reportedly in reference to a former snuff-like use of the dried and powdered flowers of this plant by members of some native American Indian tribes for treatment of blocked sinuses.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun. Prefers rich, moist soils. Intolerant of dry soils. Avoid overfertilization which may cause plants to grow too tall. Although not required, plants may be cut back in early June (at least six weeks before normal flowering) to reduce plant height and to encourage branching, thus leading to a more floriferous bloom, healthier foliage and less need for support. Remove spent flowers to encourage additional bloom. Cut back plants by 1/2 after flowering. Divide clumps as needed (every 3-4 years) to maintain vigor.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Helenium autumnale, commonly called sneezeweed, is an erect, clump-forming, Missouri native perennial which occurs in moist soils along streams, ponds or ditches and in spring-fed meadows, prairie and wet open ground throughout most of the State (Steyermark). Typically grows 3-5' tall on rigid, distinctively winged stems which branch near the top. Features clusters of daisy-like flowers (2"" diameter) with distinctive wedge-shaped, bright yellow rays (three-lobed at the tips) and prominent, dome-like, dull yellow center disks. Flowers appear over a lengthy late summer to autumn (sometimes to first frost) bloom as indicated by species name. Alternate, lance-shaped, dark green leaves (to 6"" long).Genus name comes from the Greek name helenion which is the name of a Greek plant which honors Helen of Troy.  It is unclear as to the relevance of Helen of Troy to the within genus of plants which are exclusively native to North and South America.The specific epithet autumnale refers to the plant's autumn flowering.Powdered disk flowers and leaves of this species have in the past been dried and used as snuff, thus giving rise to the common name of sneezeweed.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Foliage is susceptible to powdery mildew, leaf spot and rust. This species generally requires some staking or other support and will benefit from pinching or July-cutback as detailed above. Deer tend to avoid this plant.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Helenium flexuosum, commonly called purple-headed sneezeweed, is most easily distinguished from other sneezeweeds by its spherical, brownish-purple center disk. It is an erect, clump-forming perennial that is native to the eastern and midwestern U.S. In Missouri, it typically occurs in moist soils along streams, sink hole ponds, sloughs, ditches, swamps, swampy meadows, upland prairie depressions, pastures and fields, mostly in the central and southern portions of the State south of the Missouri River (Steyermark). This is a single-stemmed plant that branches near the top, typically growing 1-3’ tall. Stem is distinctively winged below. Daisy-like flowers (to 1.5” across) with wedge-shaped, drooping, bright yellow rays (three-lobed at the tips) and prominent, rounded, brownish-purple center disks bloom from summer to fall. Alternate, lance-shaped, dark green basal leaves to 8” long, with shorter sessile stem leaves.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun. Prefers rich, moist soils. Intolerant of dry soils. Avoid overfertilization, which may cause plants to grow too tall. Although not required, plants may be cut back in May-early June to reduce plant height and to encourage branching, thus leading to a more floriferous bloom, healthier foliage and less need for support. Remove spent flowers to encourage additional bloom. Cut back plants by 1/2 after flowering. Divide clumps as needed (every 3-4 years) to maintain vigor.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Helenium virginicum, commonly called Virginia sneezeweed, is currently listed by the federal government as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and by the State of Virginia as endangered. This plant was originally believed to exist only on the margins of about 30 seasonally flooded sinkhole ponds and meadows in two adjacent counties in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. Although a plant population was discovered in far-away Missouri near Pomona in 1960, considerable skepticism as to its true identity continued for the next 40 years. Finally, DNA testing performed in 2000 validated the Missouri population as H. virginicum. Renewed search efforts in 2003-2004 resulted in the discovery of 44 different plant populations in 5 separate Missouri counties in the Ozarks. The plant is now listed as threatened by the State of Missouri. Although theories have been proposed, there is no generally accepted answer at this point as to why this plant only exists in two geographically distant areas. Virginia sneezeweed typically grows 2-3.5’ tall on winged stems rising from a clump of basal leaves that vary in shape from oblong to broad in the middle. Lance-shaped stem leaves become progressively smaller toward the top of the stem. Basal leaves and lower stem leaves have distinctive coarse hairs. Flowers bloom from late July to early October and feature wedge-shaped, drooping, bright yellow rays with prominent rounded dull yellow center disks. Plants are similar to the common Helenium autumnale, except for growing habitat, leaf and stem hairs and leaf shape.Genus name comes from the Greek name helenion which is the name of a Greek plant which honors Helen of Troy.  It is unclear as to the relevance of Helen of Troy to the within genus of plants which are exclusively native to North and South America.Specific epithet means of Virginia.Powdered disk flowers and leaves of the sneezeweeds have in the past been dried and used as snuff, thus giving rise to the common name.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Sneezeweed foliage is generally susceptible to powdery mildew, leaf spot and rust.
","
Garden Uses
Ongoing efforts are taking place to increase populations of this rare species in the wild. At this time, this threatened/endangered species cannot be legally collected from the wild and is not available for purchase in plant or seed form.

Culture
Best grown in dry, alkaline, rocky or sandy, well-drained loams in full sun. Foliage is evergreeen, but plants are not reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5 where they appreciate a winter mulch (preferably a cover of evergreen boughs). Plants prefer cool summers and warm winters, which makes them less than ideally suited for the St. Louis climate. Shear plants after flowering to shape and to encourage additional growth. If grown as a ground cover, space 2-3’ apart.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Helianthemum nummularium, commonly called sun rose, is a low-growing, woody-stemmed, shrub-like plant with evergreen foliage. It typically grows 8-12” tall and spreads by creeping stems to 3’ wide. Five-petaled, rose-like flowers (to 1” diameter) bloom for up to 2 months (late spring to early summer) in terminal cymes. Flowers have somewhat variable coloration, but most often feature pastel yellows and pinks. Each flower opens for only one day, but in the proper growing environment, bloom can be so profuse as to cover the entire plant to the point of obscuring the foliage. Grayish-green, lance-shaped leaves (1-2” long).Genus name comes from the Greek words helios meaning the sun and anthemon meaning meaning a flower.Specific epithet means resembling a coin.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Rots easily in poorly-drained soils.

Culture
Annual. Easily grown in average, moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates poor soils that are on the dry side. Plant seed in the garden after last frost date. Plants grow so rapidly that there is little reason to start seed indoors. Taller varieties should be sited in locations sheltered from strong winds. Plant foliage often depreciates as the summer progresses. Removal of browned and tattered plants from the garden after bloom may improve the appearance of the landscape, but is a great disappointment to local bird populations that love to feed on the seeds. If the plants must come down, consider saving the seed heads for feeding the birds in winter. Harvest seed from favorite plants for use the following year (some cultivars will not reliably come true from seed however).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Helianthus annuus is native to dry plains, prairies, meadows and foothills in the western U.S., Canada and northern Mexico. It is a coarse, hairy, leafy, fast-growing annual that typically grows 5-10’ tall on stiff upright stalks. The species is a somewhat weedy plant that is now commonly seen growing along roads, fences, fields and in waste areas west of the Mississippi River and is the state flower of Kansas. It is native to Missouri, primarily in the northern part of the State. Species plants feature 3-6” wide sunflowers with orange-yellow rays and brown to purple center disks. Flowers bloom in summer. Extensive crossing and hybridizing have resulted in a large number of cultivars that greatly expand the range of flower colors (ray flowers in bright and pastel shades of yellow, red, mahogany, bronze, white and bicolors) and flower head shapes (short rays, long rays, some doubles). Dwarf varieties (1-3’ tall) and mammoth varieties (to 15’ tall) are also available. Flower heads on mammoth varieties can reach 12” in diameter. Disk flowers give way to the familiar sunflower seeds. Large, ovate to triangular, sandpapery leaves to 12” long. Sunflowers have become very popular commercial cut flowers throughout the world. Cultivated varieties are also commercially grown for their edible seeds which are used inter alia in livestock feed, as birdseed and for cooking oils.Genus name comes from the Greek words helios meaning sun and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet means annual.Flower heads tend to follow the path of the sun each day from morning to night, hence the common name.
","
Problems
Rust, leaf fungal spots and powdery mildew are somewhat common. Caterpillars and beetles often chew on the foliage. May need staking, particularly if grown in exposed locations.
","
Garden Uses
Specimen or mass. Borders, cottage gardens, bird gardens, wildflower or native plant gardens. Large varieties for border rears or backgrounds. Dwarf varieties for beds, border fronts or containers.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Helianthus maximiliani, commonly called Maximilian sunflower, is native to the Great Plains and former tall grass prairie regions of central North America. In Missouri, it is typically found today in dry open areas such as prairies, bald knobs, bluffs, limestone glades, roadsides and waste areas (Steyermark). Features 2-3” diameter sunflowers with yellow rays and darker yellow center disks from mid-summer into fall. Flowers appear on short stalks in the upper leaf axils in an elongated raceme-like inflorescence atop rigid hairy stems rising to as much as 10’ tall. Stems are clad with rough, narrow, tapered, grayish-green leaves (3-6” long), frequently folded lengthwise.Genus name comes from the Greek words helios meaning sun and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet honors German Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied who explored parts of the American West in 1832-1834. His expedition up the Missouri River originated in St. Louis in 1833.Common name also honors German Prince Maximilian.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates some light shade.  Plants generally tolerate a wide variety of soils, including average, sandy and poor rocky soils, as long as drainage is good.  Avoid clay soils.  Plant seeds in the garden after last spring frost date.  Best to site plants in locations sheltered from strong winds.  Plant foliage often depreciates as the summer progresses.  Removal of browned and tattered seed heads, foliage and plant stalks from the garden after bloom may improve the appearance of the landscape, but often becomes a great disappointment to local bird populations (particularly goldfinches) which love to feed on the seeds.  If the plants must come down, consider saving the seed heads for feeding the birds in winter.  Plants will spread in the garden by rhizomes and self-seeding to form colonies.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Helianthus mollis, commonly called ashy sunflower, hairy sunflower or downy sunflower, is a rhizomatous perennial sunflower of the aster family that typically grows to 2-4’ tall.  It is native to dry prairies, dry open woods, rocky glades, fields, thickets, roadsides, and railroad right-of-ways from Ohio to Wisconsin south to Texas and Georgia.  

Conspicuously pubescent gray-green leaves (to 6” long) and stems project a grayish ash-like foliage color, thus giving rise to the common name of ashy sunflower.  Stems are clad with coarse, stalkless or stem-clasping, broad oval leaves (to 6” long) with rounded to cordate bases.  Flowers develop singly from the upper stems, with each flower (to 4” diameter) having 15-30 showy petal-like yellow rays surrounding a central disk (to 1” diameter) of tiny darker yellow disk florets.  Flowers bloom in mid-season (July-September).  Plants spread into broad clumps that are often difficult to properly maintain in a formal border.Genus name comes from the Greek words helios meaning sun and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet from Latin means soft in reference to the downy plant hairs.Flower heads tend to follow the path of the sun each day from morning to night, hence the common name of sunflower.
","
Problems
Rust, leaf fungal spots and powdery mildew are somewhat common.  Caterpillars and beetles often chew on the foliage.  May need staking, particularly if grown in exposed locations.
","
Garden Uses
Small groups or mass.  Borders, cottage gardens, bird gardens, butterfly gardens, wildflower or native plant gardens, and meadows.  Will thrive in sunny areas.  Some birds love to eat seeds directly from the seedheads.  Perhaps best in naturalized areas where it can spread to form large colonies as opposed to the formality of typical borders.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Helianthus occidentalis, commonly called western sunflower, is one of the shortest of the many sunflowers that are native to the United States. It is a Missouri native plant that occurs in glades, prairies, dry meadows, fields and rocky open woods in central and southern Missouri (Steyermark). Large, long-stalked, ovate to oblong-lanceolate, basal leaves (to 8” long) form a 4-8” tall foliage clump. Sunflowers (to 2” diameter) with orange-yellow rays and yellow disks appear on stiff, almost naked, flower stems that typically rise to a height of 2-3’ (less frequently to 4’) tall. Blooms from mid-summer to fall. Western sunflower is actually native to eastern and central North America, not western North America. This plant is also sometimes commonly called naked stemmed sunflower and fewleaf sunflower in reference to the almost total absence of leaves from the flowering stems.Genus name comes from the Greek words helios meaning sun and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet means west in the sense that North America is west of Europe.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Helianthus silphioides, commonly called rosinweed sunflower or Ozark sunflower, is an herbaceous perennial that, as the specific epithet suggests, is very similar in appearance to plants in the genus Silphium. It is native to the south central U.S. (Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama). Sunflowers (3” diameter) with yellow rays and dark reddish-purple center disks bloom from mid/late summer to fall (August – October) on hispid stems rising to 3-10’ tall. Opposite, broad ovate to suborbicular, basal and cauline leaves (2-6” long) are blunt-tipped or rounded. Leaves on the upper portions of the plant are substantially smaller and sparser. In Missouri, rosinweed sunflower is typically found in alluvial soils near streams, fields, wood margins, dry upland open woods, thickets and roadsides in the far south to southeastern part of the state (Steyermark).Genus name comes from the Greek words helios meaning sun and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet means similar in appearance to plants in the genus Silphium.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Helianthus tuberosus, commonly called Jerusalem artichoke, sunchoke or sunroot, is a type of sunflower which is native to old fields, moist thickets, forest margins, streambanks, railroads, road margins and open places in North America.  Original native territory is difficult to determine but probably extends from Newfoundland to Saskatchewan south to Georgia, Tennessee and Arkansas, however plants have naturalized over time throughout the entire U.S. and are currently found in all states except Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Alaska and Hawaii.  This plant is ornamentally grown in landscapes for its attractive late summer to fall sunflowers and/or in vegetable gardens for its knobby edible tubers which are produced below-ground on white rhizomes.  Tubers purportedly have an artichoke-like taste.  

Jerusalem artichoke and common sunflower are both members of the same genus Helianthus within the composite family.  Both produce showy yellow sunflowers on tall stems.  

This plant features rough-hairy (often branched near the top) stems which rise to 6-10’ tall bearing rough, ovate, serrate-dentate leaves (4-8” long along main stem) on winged petioles.  Lower leaves are typically opposite but upper leaves are typically alternate.  Numerous yellow sunflowers (to 2-4” across) bloom in August-September.  Each flower has 12 to 20 showy, petal-like, bright yellow rays (each to 1 1/2” long) surrounding a yellow center disk (to 1” diameter) of tiny darker yellow disk florets.  Fertile disk florets give way to achenes (seeds to 1/4” long). 

Jerusalem artichoke is typically weedy and invasive.  Once planted in the landscape, it is usually difficult to remove, and typically spreads to form colonies.     

Jerusalem artichoke was an important food plant for native Americans for many years prior to 1600.   The French explorer Samuel de Champlain reportedly found this plant growing at Cape Cod in 1605.  Tubers were brought back to Europe where they were widely planted, with the tubers becoming a common vegetable food crop in a number of areas by 1650.  Plants are still grown today for harvest of the tubers which begins about 2 weeks after the flowers fade.  Each plant typically produces 2-5 pounds of tubers per year.  Raw tubers have a nutty flavor.  Tubers may be grated raw into salads, boiled and/or mashed somewhat like potatoes, roasted or added to soups.  Unlike potatoes, tubers do not contain starch.  They do contain inulin which converts into fructose which is better tolerated by people with type 2 diabetes than sucrose.Genus name comes from the Greek words helios meaning sun and anthos meaning flower.Specific epithet from Latin means tuberous in obvious reference to the edible underground tubers.Notwithstanding its common name, however, Jerusalem artichoke is not a type of artichoke (thistle-like plant).  Moreover, it is native to North America with no connection to the city of Jerusalem in Israel. Jerusalem artichoke probably comes from the Italian name for this plant, girasole articiocco, which means sunflower artichoke in reference to flower appearance and tuber taste, with Jerusalem probably being a mispronunciation of girasole.
","
Problems
Rust, leaf fungal spots and powdery mildew are somewhat common.  Caterpillars and beetles often chew on the foliage.  May need staking, particularly if grown in exposed locations.
","
Garden Uses
Small groups or mass.  Borders, vegetable gardens, cottage gardens, bird gardens, butterfly gardens, wildflower or native plant gardens, and meadows.  Will thrive in sunny areas.  Due to tall size and invasive tendencies, this plant is perhaps best sited in naturalized areas or rear corners of perennial borders/vegetable gardens where it can spread to form colonies.  It is generally considered to be an inappropriate selection for formal borders.  

Butterflies love the flowers.  Some songbirds love to eat plant seeds directly from the seedheads.

Culture
Tender evergreen perennial that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-10. In St. Louis, it is grown as an annual. It is easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Tolerates poor soils. Superior soil drainage is the key to growing this plant well. Start seed indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost date. Set seedlings or purchased plants out after last frost date. Plants may self-seed in optimum growing conditions, but many of the cultivars will not come true from seed. Containers may be brought indoors before first frost for overwintering or cuttings may be taken in late summer for overwintering.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Helichrysum petiolare, commonly called licorice plant, is grown for its silvery, densely-felted foliage and trailing habit. It is a shrubby, woody-based tender perennial that typically grows 1-2’ tall but spreads to as much as 3-4’ wide on upright to trailing stems densely clad with soft, woolly, oval-rounded, gray-green leaves (1.5” long). When grown as annuals, plants generally grow to 6-9” tall and usually will not flower. Overwintered plants may flower the second year. Tiny white flowers, if and when they do bloom, are insignificant and often removed by gardeners as they appear. Plant foliage may exude a slight licorice aroma in the heat of the summer, hence the common name. Cultivars with variegated and chartreuse leaves are available.Genus name comes from the Greek words helios meaning the sun and chrysos meaning golden.Specific epithet means with a leaf-stalk or a particularly long one.
","
Problems
Susceptible to root rot, particularly in poorly drained soils.

Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates some light shade.  Tolerates drought.  Generally tolerates a wide range of soils, including poor, infertile ones.  May be grown as an annual by starting seed indoors in late January to early February.  In the alternative, seed may be planted directly in the garden after last spring frost date.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Heliopsis multiflora, commonly called goldeneye, is an upright, clump-forming perennial of the aster family that typically grows to 1-4’ tall.  It is noted for producing a mid to late summer (July–September) bloom of small-headed, sunflower-like flowers (to 1 1/2” diameter) featuring golden yellow rays surrounding yellow to bronze-yellow center cones.  Each flower is subtended by a whorl of involucre bracts in 2-5 rows.  Goldeneye is native to dry soils in sunny areas of foothills, meadows, slopes, alpine regions near timberline and roadsides from Idaho and Montana south to California and Texas with a concentration in montane areas of the Rocky Mountains.  Flowers bloom atop stiff stems clad with rough, narrow-ovate to lanceolate-linear, opposite, leaves (each to 1-3” long) with entire to slightly serrated margins.    

This species is closely related to Helianthus (true sun flower), except flowers are smaller and more numerous.  Formerly known by the synonymous name of Viguiera multiflora. 

This flower was first named Heliomeris multiflora in 1848 by Thomas Nuttall (1786-1859), British botanist.  It was later named Viguiera multiflora in 1918 by S. F. Blake in honor of Alexandre L. Viguier (1790-1867) of Vermont, with this synonymous genus name of Viguiera still persisting at present as the accepted genus name among some experts.Genus name is from the Greek helios meaning sun and meris meaning part.Specific epithet from Latin means many-flowered in reference to its profuse bloom of summer flowers.‘Sunsplash’ produces an abundant bloom of bicolor flowers which feature light yellow rays with creamy white margins and yellow center cones.  It is more compact than the species, typically growing to 24” tall.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Red aphids are occasional visitors.  Reportedly has some resistance to powdery mildew.
","
Garden Uses
Rock gardens, beds, borders and meadows.  Edging.  Often short-termed perennial that is sometimes grown as an annual.  Containers.

Tolerates some light shade, but plants are less vigorous and stems need support in heavier shade. Remove spent flowers to extend bloom season. Plant stems may be cut back by 1/3 to 1/2 in late May to reduce overall plant height.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Heliopsis helianthoides, commonly called ox eye, is an upright, clump-forming, nearly glabrous, sunflower-like, short-lived perennial that is native to eastern and central North America.  It typically grows to 3-4' tall and features daisy-like flowers (2-3” diameter) with yellow-orange rays surrounding brownish-yellow center cones.  Flowers bloom throughout summer atop stiff stems clad with ovate, toothed leaves (to 6"" long).  

Plants in the genus Heliopsis are both similar in appearance to and closely related to those in the genus Helianthus, the true sunflower.  Heliopsis is sometimes commonly called false sunflower.Genus name comes from the Greek words helios meaning the sun and opsis meaning resembling in allusion to the rayed yellow flower heads.Specific epithet means resembling the genus Helianthus.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Some susceptibility to aphids. Taller plants may need staking or other support.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. In St. Louis, grow as a summer bedding annual, in containers or as a houseplant. Best grown in moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants appreciate some afternoon shade in hot summer climates however. Soils should not be allowed to dry out. Start seeds indoors 10-12 weeks before last frost date. Set out plants after last frost date. Pinch back stems to encourage bushy growth. Deadhead spent flowers to encourage additional bloom. Bedding plants can be allowed to die each fall, with new plants purchased or raised from seed each spring. Larger potted or container plants may be overwintered in bright cool (50s) locations. Cuttings can be taken from garden plants in late summer for overwintering if desired.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Heliotropium arborescens, commonly called heliotrope, is native to Peru. It is a tender perennial shrub that grows 2-6’ tall in its native habitat. In St. Louis, it is usually grown as a summer annual bedding plant or container plant where it will typically grow 12-18” tall in a growing season. Overwintered container plants may grow taller. This plant is an old garden favorite. Features sweetly fragrant, tiny violet flowers in large showy clusters which bloom summer to fall. Rough, oval, dark green leaves (to 3” long) are prominently veined.Genus name comes from the Greek word heliotropion from helios meaning the sun and trope meaning a turning an allusion to an old disproved idea that the  flower heads turned with the sun.Specific epithet means tending to be woody or with a tree-like form.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for whiteflies, spider mites, aphids and mealybugs, particularly on overwintering plants or houseplants.

Locate plants in areas protected from cold winter winds. May self-seed in optimum growing conditions once established in the garden. May not be reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5. Cut back flowering stems after bloom to promote new foliage growth. This is an evergreen plant that takes two years to bloom when grown from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Helleborus foetidus, commonly called stinking hellebore, is an evergreen perennial that typically grows to 24” tall and is noted for its deeply divided dark green foliage and late winter to early spring bloom (February – April). Leaves are deeply lobed and divided into 7-10, narrow, lance-shaped to elliptic, usually-toothed segments. Clusters (cymes) of drooping, bell-shaped, greenish-white flowers (to 1” diameter) subtended by pale green bracts bloom at the tips of leafy stems commencing in February. Flowers and bruised foliage are unpleasantly aromatic (foeditus meaning fetid), thus giving rise to a number of somewhat hyperbolic common names for the species including stinking hellebore, stinkwort and dungwort. Many gardeners consider the actual aroma to be more unpleasant or unusual than fetid. Leaf shape gives rise to an additional common name of bear’s foot. Leaves, stems and roots are poisonous. Although foliage is evergreen, it may become scorched and tattered in extremely harsh winters, particularly if not insulated by snow cover.Genus name comes from the Greek words bora meaning ""food"" and helein meaning ""injures/destroys"" in reference to the plant’s toxic leaves, stems and roots which are poisonous to humans if ingested.Specific epithet of foeditus means fetid.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Crown rot and leaf spot are occasional problems.
","
Garden Uses
Flowers that bloom in February in St. Louis are true harbingers of spring. Locate plants near a kitchen window, patio or walkway so that the early bloom may be enjoyed to the fullest. Group in shady locations under trees, large shrubs or in woodland gardens. May also be incorporated into a naturalized area where the clumps will slowly spread through self-seeding. Mass for an attractive year round ground cover.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Helleborus niger, commonly called Christmas rose, is a winter-blooming evergreen perennial which blooms around Christmas time in warm winter regions, but later (February or March) in the cold northern parts of the growing range.  Bloom time can vary considerably based upon the degree of severity of the winter climate.  It is native to alpine areas and open woodlands in southern and central Europe.  This plant typically grows to 8-15"" tall and features large, cup-shaped, rose-like white flowers (to 3"" diameter) with crowns of conspicuously contrasting yellow stamens.  Each flower has five large and showy petal-like sepals (petals are quite small and inconspicuous).  Flowers usually appear singly on thick stems which usually do not rise above the foliage. This is an acaulescent species (without stems) which produces only basal leaves, each being palmate, deeply-lobed, somewhat waxy, and dark green with 7-9 leaflets.  In the St. Louis area, leaves remain evergreen in moderate winters, but may become somewhat tattered in extremely cold winter areas where temperatures dip below zero, particularly if foliage is not protected by snow cover.  Flowers sometimes bloom in the snow and bloom can survive spurts of sub-zero temperatures.Genus name comes from the Greek words bora meaning ""food"" and helein meaning ""injures/destroys"" in reference to the plant’s toxic leaves, stems and roots which are poisonous to humans if ingested.Specific epithet comes from the Latin word niger meaning black in reference to the color of the roots.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Helleborus orientalis, commonly called Lenten rose, is a clump-forming, late winter-blooming perennial which typically grows 1-1.5' tall. Features large, cup-shaped, rose-like, usually nodding flowers (3-4"" diameter) with center crowns of conspicuously contrasting yellow stamens. Flowers usually appear in clusters of 1-4 on thick stems rising above the foliage. Flower color is extremely variable, ranging from white to pink to light rose-purple, frequently with interior spotting. Palmate, serrate, leathery, 8-16"" wide, glossy, basal, dark green leaves (7-9 leaflets) are evergreen in warm climates but deciduous in extremely cold winters. In the St. Louis area, plants will remain evergreen in moderate winters, but may become scorched and tattered in extremely cold weather, particularly if not insulated by snow cover. Blooms in late winter (sometimes when snow is still present) and continues into spring, with a long, 8-10 week bloom period. Leaves, stems and roots are poisonous.Genus name comes from the Greek words bora meaning ""food"" and helein meaning ""injures/destroys"" in reference to the plant’s toxic leaves, stems and roots which are poisonous to humans if ingested.Specific epithet means from the Orient.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Leaf spot and crown rot are occasional problems. A rugged and easy-to-grow plant.

Culture
Giant hogweed is on the Federal Noxious Weed list which prohibits the importation, interstate transportation and sale of this plant without a permit. The two main vices of hogweed are (1) it is an invasive self-seeder that colonizes and crowds out native species plants and (2) it produces a sap which, on contact with skin, leads to a skin reaction known as phytophotodermatitis in which severe blisters and rashes typically occur when the skin is exposed to ultra violet light (sun or UV rays). Giant hogweed easily grows in moist, fertile, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best performance is in full sun. Plants are biennials or short-term perennials. Plants can rapidly colonize areas through self-seeding (wind and water). To help prevent self-seeding, remove and destroy the spent inflorescences of existing plants with care (see below) before seed matures.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Heracleum mantegazzianum, commonly called giant hogweed or cartwheel flower, is an herbaceous biennial or short-lived perennial that is noted for producing rapid and prodigious growth often to the detriment of native plants. Native to Eurasia, it was reportedly first brought to the U.S. in 1917 to an ornamental garden in New York. Ornamental plantings became common prior to the point where the characteristics and problems of this plant were clearly understood. Giant hogweed has over time escaped gardens and naturalized (roadside ditches, stream banks, fields, unused farmland, railroad track right-of-ways and along fences) in a number of areas in North America, primarily including the northeastern and northwestern U.S. plus parts of Canada. In the first year, this plant produces a huge mound of coarse, ternate-compound, basal leaves (each to as much as 3' long) with deeply cut leaflets. In the second year, the plant will rise up to as much as 10-16' tall topped by a gigantic, flat-topped, umbrella-like, compound umbel to 2-4' wide. Each umbel contains thousands of tiny white flowers. Flowers bloom in late June. Sometimes a plant does not flower until one or two years later. After flowering and fruiting, the plant dies. Unfortunately each large flower umbel has about 20,000 seeds. Green stems are hollow and distinguished by white hairs and purple blotches. Giant hogweed is in the same genus as the cow parsnip (Heracleum maximum) which is native to North America.Genus name comes from a variant of the Greek words herakleia or panakes herakleion in honor of Hercules (Gr. Herakles).Specific epithet honors Italian anthropologist and traveler Paolo Mantegazzi (1831-1910).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Protective clothing, gloves and eye goggles should be used when working with this plant. Removal of plants from the landscape is best done by application of herbicides. Seeds in the soil can germinate as much as 15-20 years later, necessitating post-removal monitoring.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Herniaria hirsuta, commonly called hairy rupturewort, a somewhat inconspicuous, low-growing annual that is native from central to southern Europe.  Genus name and common name both relate to a formerly held belief that this plant was a medically effective remedy in the treatment of hernias.  It has been introduced into North America with naturalization having now occurred in some parts of the U.S. (Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, Wisconsin, New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Maryland).  Everything about this plant is diminutive.  It is a low-growing, trailing to mat-forming, stiffly-hairy annual that typically rises to only 1-2"" tall but spreads along the ground to 6-8"" on branched prostrate stems clad with dense, stalkless, elliptic to oblanceolate, tiny, pale green leaves (each to 1/3"" long).  Inflorescence is an axillary cyme containing 3-8 tiny yellowish-green flowers (each to 1/15"" wide) which bloom from late spring to mid-summer.  Cymes are clustered along the stems.Genus name comes from hernia meaning a rupture for which the plant was once supposed to treat.The specific epithet comes from the Latin word hirsutus meaning hairy.

Culture
Easily grown in dry, sandy, sharply-drained soils in full sun.  Thrives in hot, dry, desert conditions, but is also surprisingly winter hardy to USDA Zone 5.  The key to growing this plant well is having superior soil drainage.  Excellent heat resistance and drought tolerance.  Will self-seed in the landscape.  May be propagated by clump division. Tolerates urban conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hesperaloe parviflora, commonly known as red yucca, coral yucca, hummingbird yucca, redflower false yucca, and samandoque, is a yucca-like evergreen perennial succulent.  It is native to the Chihuahuan desert in western Texas south into northeastern Mexico where it is typically found growing in desert areas, prairies, rocky slopes, and mesquite groves.  Although it is closely related to yuccas, it is a member of the century plant family not the yucca family.  Narrow, arching, sword-like, blue-green leaves (2-3’ long but only 1” wide) grow in basal clumps to 3-4’ tall spreading to 6’ wide.  Although the leaves are evergreen, they often acquire purple or reddish-bronze tints in cold winter climates.  Each leaf has distinctive thread-like marginal hairs.  Red to pink tubular flowers in branching inflorescences rise well above the foliage clump on red flower stalks to 4-6’ tall.  In cold winter climates, flowers bloom in early to mid summer with frequent rebloom into fall, but in warm winter climates plants often bloom earlier with continued bloom occurring throughout much of the year.  Excellent hummingbird plant.Genus name comes from the Greek word hesperos meaning western in reference to the plant being native to North America (in the West) and aloe in reference to the plant somewhat resembling plants in the genus Aloe.Specific epithet comes from the Latin parva meaning small and flora meaning flower in reference to its small flowers.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Deer like to feed on the unarmed foliage and flower spikes.  Aphids often appear when flowers are in bloom.  Watch for scale.
","
Garden Uses
Desert gardens, rock gardens, path margins.  Also can be massed for enjoyment of its long summer bloom.  Good large container plant.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Best in part shade in hot summer climates. A short-lived perennial or biennial that remains in the garden for years as a result of prolific self-seeding. Prompt removal of spent flowers may encourage a second flush of bloom. Plants can become woody at the base and persist for a number of years, but are best replaced with new seedlings. Easily grown from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hesperis matronalis is an upright, multi-branched, short-lived perennial or biennial which typically grows 2-3' tall (less frequently to 4'). Features white, lavender or purple, 1/2"", 4-petaled flowers in loose, terminal racemes which bloom in late spring. Flowers are very fragrant, particularly in the evening. Serrate, ovate to lance-shaped, dark green foliage. Native to Eurasia, but has naturalized in many areas of eastern North America as a garden escapee.Genus name comes from the Greek word hespera meaning the evening for their evening fragrance.Specific epithet refers to March 1, which was the Roman festival of the matrons (married ladies).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent plant for meadows, naturalized areas or cottage gardens. May also be grown in borders, but foliage tends to disappear after flowering, thus necessitating the use of annuals or late-developing perennials to fill in the gaps.

Culture
Best grown in organically rich, humusy, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Performs well in full sun in the north, but prefers some shade (particularly in the heat of the afternoon) in the south. In the St. Louis area, best foliage color may occur in sunny spots with part afternoon shade. Scorch and general foliage decline usually occur if soils are allowed to dry out. If grown in full sun, consistent moisture is particularly important. Remove stems of faded flowers to encourage additional bloom. On the other hand, some gardeners prefer to remove flower stems before flowering if plants are being grown as ground covers for their foliage texture and color. Foliage is essentially evergreen in warm winter climates, but the amount of retained foliage color in cold winter climates such as St. Louis depends in large part upon the severity of the temperatures. In cold winter climates, a winter mulch applied after the ground freezes will help prevent root heaving. Divide clumps in spring every 3-4 years.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Heuchera americana, commonly called coral bells or alumroot, is a clump-forming Missouri native perennial which occurs in somewhat dryish locations in rocky open woodlands and along ledges and crevices of bluffs. Typically features a 12- to 15-inch-tall basal clump of heart-shaped, 5- to 7-lobed, long-petioled leaves (3-5"" wide), which emerge flushed with purplish-brown and mature to a uniform green. Tiny, greenish-white, bell-shaped flowers in open, airy panicles are borne on slender, wiry stems extending well above the mound of leaves, typically to a height of 18-24"" (infrequently to 3 feet) in late spring to early summer.Genus name honors Johann Heinrich von Heucher (1677-1747), physician, botanist and medicinal plant expert at Wittenberg University, Germany.Specific epithet means of North or South America.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Heuchera cylindrica, commonly called poker heuchera or roundleaf alumroot, is native to rocky woods, cliffs, ledges, slopes and subalpine meadows in northwestern North America from British Columbia and Alberta south to Northern California, Northern Nevada and Colorado. It is a mounding perennial that features ovate to broadly heart-shaped, leathery, usually hairy, maple-like, dark green leaves (to 3"" wide) with toothed and scalloped margins. Leaves typically form a compact basal mound to 6” tall and to 12” wide. Small, cup-shaped, cream to yellowish green flowers, densely packed in spike-like panicles to 6"" long, bloom from late spring to summer atop tall, slender, leafless flowering stems rising well above the foliage mound to 20-30” tall. This heuchera is commonly called poker heuchera in reference to its poker-like spikes of creamy flowers. It is also commonly called roundleaf alumroot in reference to its rounded leaves.Genus name honors Johann Heinrich von Heucher (1677-1747), physician, botanist and medicinal plant expert at Wittenberg University, Germany.Specific epithet means long and round, cylindrical.

Noteworthy Characteristics
BRESSINGHAM BRONZE is a clump-forming, coral bells cultivar that features dark, metallic bronze foliage with contrasting white summer flowers. It most closely resembles H. micrantha var. diversifolia 'Purple Palace', but is primarily distinguished therefrom by having larger, stronger-ribbed leaves that are a deeper purple-bronze. Foliage typically forms a basal mound to 12-20"" tall and as wide. Foliage typically retains good color throughout the growing season. Tiny, bell-shaped, white flowers borne in open, airy panicles appear in summer on slender, wiry stems rising above the foliage mound to as much as 28"" tall. BRESSINGHAM BRONZE was discovered by Blooms of Bressingham in 1986 and was subsequently introduced under the cultivar name of 'Absi'. U. S. Plant Patent PP08,858 was issued on August 9, 1994.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Frost heaving of roots may occur when winter temperatures fluctuate widely. Good resistance to powdery mildew.

Noteworthy Characteristics
This heuchera is native from Missouri to Kentucky, Tennessee and Arkansas. In Missouri, it is most often found growing on northern or eastern facing shaded limestone bluffs (Steyermark). This is a clump-forming plant that typically grows in a basal mound to 12"" tall. Leaves (to 5"" wide) have long petioles, 5-7 shallow rounded lobes, crenate margins and cordate bases. Slender flowering stems rise to 18"" in late summer featuring white to pink flowers in open airy panicles. Flowers typically bloom from late July to September, but sometimes later. Leaf undersides, leaf-stalks and flowering stems are densely covered with minute hairs (puberulent as the variety name suggests).
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Frost heaving of roots may occur when winter temperatures fluctuate widely.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Heuchera richardsonii is a clump-forming Missouri native coral bells which occurs in somewhat dryish locations on prairies, open woodland slopes, uplands, banks and along railroads. Typically features a 12-18"" tall basal clump of heart-shaped, shallow-lobed, long-petioled, green leaves (2-3"" wide) which show some white mottling or purple blush when young, maturing to a more uniform green. Tiny, greenish, bell-shaped flowers in open, airy panicles are borne on slender, wiry stems extending well above the mound of leaves, typically to a height of 18-24"" (infrequently to 3') in spring to early summer. Flower stems and leaf undersides are distinctively hairy.Genus name honors Johann Heinrich von Heucher (1677-1747), physician, botanist and medicinal plant expert at Wittenberg University, Germany.Specific epithet may honor English physician and botanist Richard Richardson (1663-1741).

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 3-8 where it is best grown in humusy, organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Performs well in rocky soils.  Avoid heavy clay soils.  Best in full sun in cool northern climates, but prefers some part afternoon shade in hot southern climates.  In the St. Louis area, best foliage color typically occurs in sunny spots with part afternoon shade.  If grown in full sun, consistent moisture is particularly important.  Scorch and general foliage decline often occur if soils are allowed to dry out.  Foliage is essentially evergreen in warm winter climates, but the amount of retained foliage color in cold winter climates such as St. Louis depends in large part upon the severity of the temperatures.  In cold winter climates, a winter mulch applied after the ground freezes will help prevent root heaving.  Divide clumps in spring every 3-4 years.  Remove stems of faded flowers to encourage additional bloom.  Straight species plants may be grown from seed.

Culture
Best grown in organically rich, humusy, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Performs well in full sun in the north, but prefers some shade (particularly in the heat of the afternoon) in the south. In the St. Louis area, best foliage color may occur in sunny spots with part afternoon shade. This species has good drought tolerance and seems to do better in hot and humid summers than most heucheras, though some scorch and general foliage decline may occur if soils are allowed to totally dry out. If grown in full sun, consistent moisture is particularly important. Remove stems of faded flowers to encourage additional bloom.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Heuchera villosa, sometimes commonly called hairy alum root, is a species of coral bells that is native to rocky wooded slopes from Virginia to Georgia and Tennessee. It is primarily noted for its (1) large, hairy, triangularly-lobed (7-9 lobes), sharply-toothed, green leaves (to 5” across) that have a velvety texture, (2) hairy, rusty-brown flowering stems and leaf stalks and (3) mid to late summer flowering (probably the latest in the genus). Leaves typically form a rounded basal clump to 18-24” tall and as wide. Tiny, whitish to pinkish flowers (to 1/4” wide) borne in open, airy panicles appear in late summer on slender, wiry stems rising above the foliage mound to 36” tall.Genus name honors Johann Heinrich von Heucher (1677-1747), physician, botanist and medicinal plant expert at Wittenberg University, Germany.Specific epithet means covered with soft hairs.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Frost heaving of roots when winter temperatures fluctuate widely is less likely to occur with this species than with many other heucheras.

Culture
Easily grown in organically rich, moist to wet soils in full sun.  Tolerates light shade, but full sun with good air circulation generally produces the best flowers, strongest stems, and the best environment for resisting potential diseases.  Soils should never be allowed to dry out.  Regular deep watering is advisable.  Cut back stems to approximately 3-4 inches in late autumn.  New growth shoots are slow to emerge in spring.  Once new growth begins, however, it proceeds quite rapidly.  Plants will benefit from regular fertilization during the growing season.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hibiscus dasycalyx, commonly known as Neches River rose-mallow, is a rarely found perennial of the mallow family whose native territory is limited to three populations in seasonally inundated and regularly flooded bottomland areas near the Neches, Angelina and Trinity rivers in eastern Texas.  Further declines in these native populations are currently threatened by a number of factors, primarily including habitat loss and genetic contamination of the species via interspecific hybridization which occurs as a result of encroachment in the wild by the closely related Hibiscus laevis (formerly H. militaris) and Hibiscus moscheutos, both of which grow in areas where Hibiscus dasycalyx occurs.  H. laevis crosses easily with the within rare species, which makes it difficult to insure and maintain a pure genetic population.   

Three additional populations have now been introduced and established in eastern Texas in order to expand growth and help protect the species from further decline or possible extinction in the wild.  

Hibiscus dasycalyx was designated in September of 2013 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a Threatened Species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.

Neches River rose-mallow typically grows to 3-4’ (infrequently to 7’) tall and to 2-3’ wide.  Bowl-shaped white flowers (3-6” wide) bloom singly from the leaf axils in the upper parts of the plant in summer (June to August) with that bloom sometimes extending into October in optimum growing conditions.  Each flower features 5 overlapping, white (infrequently pink) petals, a dark reddish-purple center blotch and a prominent staminal column. 

This plant is sometimes commonly called narrow-leaved hibiscus because it has the narrowest, deeply 3-lobed, finely-divided leaves of any plant in the genus. Leaves emerge red-purple in spring, but mature to medium/dark green.  Rustic seedpods remain on the plant until November.  

Alternate, broad-ovate to lanceolate leaves (3-8” long) with toothed margins are green above and white-hairy beneath.  Leaves are lobeless or have 3-5 shallow lobes.Genus name is the old Greek and Latin name for mallow.Specific epithet is a combining form which comes from the Greek word dasys meaning dense or hairy in reference to the densely pubescent calyx and bracteoles on plant flowers plus the hairs on mature seeds.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Susceptible to leaf spot, blights, rust and canker.  Japanese beetles can severely damage plant foliage if left unchecked.  Hibiscus sawfly, aphids, whiteflies, mealybugs and spider mites may appear.
","
Garden Uses
Difficult to locate in commerce.  Moist borders.  Specimens.  Useful in low spots or wet areas.  Effective along streams or ponds.  Temporary summer screen or hedge.

Perhaps most easily distinguished by its three-lobed leaves (to 6"" long) which resemble the shape of the 15th-16th century halberd spear. Large, 5-petaled, hollyhock-like flowers (to 6"" diameter) with white to pink petals and maroon eyes appear from mid-summer into fall on smooth stout stems rising 4-6' tall. Each flower has a prominent and showy center staminal column. Synonymous with and formerly known as Hibiscus militaris, the specific epithet being in reference to the leaf-shape resemblance to a military weapon.Genus name is the old Greek and Latin name for mallow.Specific epithet means smooth.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Taller plants may need staking.
","
Garden Uses
A tall mallow for moist soils along bodies of water or in low spots. Also effective in border rears, cottage gardens or native plant gardens.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun.  Best in moist, organically rich soils, but does surprisingly well in average garden soils as long as those soils are not allowed to dry out.  Regular deep watering is advisable.  Immune to the heat and humidity of the deep South.  Tolerates some light shade, but full sun with good air circulation produces the best flowers, the strongest stems and the best environment for resisting potential diseases.  Site in locations protected from wind to minimize the risk of wind burn.  Pinch back growing tips when they reach 8” and again at 12” if bushy plants are desired.  Deadhead individual flowers to maintain plant appearance.  Cut back stems to approximately 3-4 inches in late autumn.  New growth shoots are slow to emerge in spring.  However, once new growth begins, it proceeds quite rapidly.  Plants will benefit from regular fertilization during the growing season.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hibiscus moscheutos, commonly known as hardy hibiscus or swamp rose mallow, is a vigorous, sturdy, rounded, somewhat shrubby, hairy-stemmed, woody-based perennial of the mallow family.  It typically grows to 3-7’ tall and to 2-4’ wide.  It is native to wet spots (marshes, swamps, floodplains, river banks, moist meadows, and moist woods) from Ontario and Massachusetts south to Ohio, Indiana, Alabama and Florida.  Showy, dinner plate-sized, hollyhock-like flowers (each to 4-6” diameter) have five overlapping white, creamy white or pink petals with reddish-purple to dark crimson bases which form a sharply contrasting central eye.  Each flower has a prominent and showy central staminal column of white to pale yellow anthers surrounding an even longer style.  Individual flowers last only 1-2 days, but new flowers open each day in rapid succession over a long July to September bloom period.  At the peak of bloom, a large plant can produce 20 or more flowers per day.  Flowers (to 6-9” wide) are among the largest flowers produced by any perennial that is winter hardy to the St. Louis area.  Alternate, broad-ovate to lanceolate leaves (3-8” long) with toothed margins are green above and white-hairy beneath.  Leaves are lobeless or have 3-5 shallow lobes.  Seed capsules will float on water which facilitates seed dispersal.Genus name is the old Greek and Latin name for mallow.Specific epithet from Latin means musk-scented.
","
Problems
Some susceptibility to leaf spots, blights, rusts and canker.  Japanese beetles can severely damage foliage if left unchecked.  Whiteflies, aphids and scale are occasional insect visitors.  Leaf scorch will occur if soils are allowed to dry out.  Healthy plants grown in the proper environment usually do not need staking.
","
Garden Uses
Moist borders.  Specimens.  Useful in low spots or wet areas in the landscape.  Effective along streams or ponds.  Temporary summer screen or hedge.  Can be grown in large containers.

Culture
Chinese hibiscus is a tropical evergreen shrub that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where it is best grown in moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants appreciate being sited in locations protected from strong winds. In the St. Louis area, plants may be grown in containers that are overwintered indoors. They also may be grown in sunny rooms (bright light but not full sun) as houseplants. Plants may also be purchased in containers in spring and grown as annuals. Plants appreciate consistent moisture and high humidity. Regular watering, misting and fertilization during the growing season are advisable. Roots should never dry out. Set container in a bed of moist pebbles to increase humidity. Plants are sensitive to changing conditions. During the growing season, moving containers to different locations or changing temperatures or poor light may result in bud drop. Plants should be overwintered in 60 degree F. locations with reduced watering and reduced fertilization. Prune out 1/3 of old wood plus cut back stems by 1/2 in early spring to keep plants healthy and compact.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, commonly called Chinese hibiscus, is a frost tender evergreen that is probably native to tropical Asia. Plants feature glabrous, toothed, shiny green leaves (to 6”) and large, funnel-like flowers (to 4-8” diameter) with stamens in a showy central tube. Plants grown outdoors year round typically rise to 10-12’ tall, and plants grown in containers that are overwintered indoors are typically trimmed to 5-6’ tall. Outdoor plants will flower throughout the year. Plants brought indoors in fall typically flower from spring to late summer. Flowers last for only one day. Indoor plants need regular pruning to maintain good shape. Another common name for plants of this species is rose of China.Genus name is the old Greek and Latin name for mallow.Specific epithet comes from rosa meaning rose and sinensis meaning Chinese.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where it is best grown in rich, moist, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants appreciate abundant watering and fertilizing when young. Plants are intolerant of drought. In areas subject to frost (all zones south of USDA Zone 10), plants should be grown in containers and (a) brought indoors before first fall frost for overwintering indoors in sunny areas with cool evening temperatures (55F to 65F) or (b) treated as annuals. Indoor plants need regular pruning to maintain compact shape. This hibiscus may be trained as a standard.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hibiscus schizopetalus, commonly called Japanese lantern, is native to tropical areas in eastern Africa. Although it is not native to Japan, its flowers droop from the branching in a manner reminiscent of Japanese lanterns, hence the common name. It typically grows as a narrow, woody, evergreen shrub to 6-9’ tall on upright-arching stems clad with ovate, serrate, dark green leaves (to 5” long). Lantern-like flowers (to 3” across) bloom seasonally on long pedicels. Each flower features recurved, fringed, pink to red petals and a long slender pendent staminal column. This plant is synonymous with and formerly known as Hibiscus rosa-sinensis var. schizopetalus. It is also commonly called fringed hibiscus or fringed rosemallow in reference to its irregularly fringed petals.Genus name is the old Greek and Latin name for mallow.The specific epithet (schizo meaning split and petalus meaning petal) is in reference to the recurved and divided petals of each flower.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for aphids. Poor lighting, temperature fluxuations, low humidity and/or irregular watering can cause buds to drop.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, grow as a specimen plant, in small groups or as a hedge or screen. In St. Louis, grow in containers that may be taken outside from May to September.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Hibiscus tiliaceus, commonly called sea hibiscus or mahoe, is an evergreen shrub or small tree that is native to tropical regions of Asia where it is often found growing along coasts and in low moist areas. It is now grown as an ornamental in tropical and subtropical areas around the world.  It has escaped gardens and naturalized along the coast in southern Florida where it is now considered to have invasive potential.  It typically grows to 12-25' tall.  Intertwined trunks and branches often sprawl over the ground to form large impenetrable colonies.  Showy funnel-shaped flowers bloom throughout the year.  Each flower has five overlapping petals and a pronounced central staminal column consisting of the stamens and pistil.  Flowers last only one day, opening in the morning as lemon yellow with dark maroon throats, but turning dull red by evening when they drop to the ground. Simple, heart-shaped leaves (to 8""long and 6"" wide) with pointed tips are bright green above and hairy gray-green beneath.  Fruits are brown ovoid dry capsules.  Roots and flowers have medicinal value.  In Asia, mahoe is harvested for the fiber in its trunk which is made into rope.Genus name is the old Greek and Latin name for mallow.Specific epithet comes from tilia, the genus of basswood/linden, in reference to leaf similarity.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hibiscus trionum is sometimes commonly called flower-of-an-hour because its white flowers will bloom for only a few hours before wilting. Native to Europe, this annual has naturalized over time by self-seeding throughout much of the U. S. where it is often now found along roadsides, railroad tracks, in waste areas and in open fields. It can be weedy in some areas. It grows to 2’ tall on branching stems clad with long-stalked, palmately divided, coarsely-toothed, dark green leaves (to 3” long) in three (infrequently five) parts. Lower leaves may be entire. Solitary white to pale yellow flowers (to 2” across) with dark purple centers bloom from the leaf axils from summer to frost. Flowers give way to bladder-like seed pods. This plant is also commonly called Venice mallow.Genus name is the old Greek and Latin name for mallow.Specific epithet means three parted in reference to plant leaves.

Culture
Easily grown in average, moist, well-drained, neutral to alkaline, sandy loams in full sun.  Tolerant of wind, cold temperatures (USDA Zone 3) and poor soils.  Plants are dioecious, so female plants will not produce fruit without a nearby male pollinator.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hippophae rhamnoides, commonly called sea buckthorn, is a large, thorny-stemmed, suckering, deciduous shrub that typically grows to 8-12' tall and as wide.  It sometimes grows in tree form, and may reach 20' tall or more in its native habitat.  It is native to Europe, Northern Asia and China.  It is often found growing in coastal areas, hence the common name.  It is particularly noted for producing both willow-like silver-green leaves which are attractive throughout the growing season and long-lasting orange berries on female plants in fall.  Narrow, linear, silver-green leaves (to 3"" long) have a scaly surface.  Non-showy, yellow-green, female flowers in small racemes appear on female plants in spring (March-April) before the leaves emerge.  Male flowers bloom in tiny catkins on male plants at the same time.  Female flowers give way to orange fall fruits (each to 1/3"" long) which persist on the branches through winter.  Fruits are used to make teas, jams, jellies, sauces and beverages, including an orange juice which is commercially produced in Germany and Russia.  Fruits are rich in vitamins A, C and E, folic acid, carotenoids, and fatty acids.  Branches are thorny.Genus name comes from the classical Greek name for another plant, probably prickly spurge.Specific epithet means resembling the genus Rhamnus.

Culture
Easily grown in evenly moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade.   Best in part shade (some morning sun or sun dappled conditions).  Established plants have some tolerance for dry shade (particularly plants with thick leaves), but soils should never be allowed to dry out.  Full size and quality form are best achieved with consistent moisture.  Water is best applied directly to the soil beneath the leaves.  Divide plants as needed in spring or autumn.  Division is usually easiest in early spring before the leaves unfurl.  Plant in locations protected from wind.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hosta lancifolia is an erect, vase-shaped, medium hosta to 12"" tall featuring a mound of lance-shaped, wavy-margined leaves that are medium green above and a glossy, lighter green beneath and racemes of funnel-shaped, violet flowers on arching scapes to 20"". A dependable and versatile perennial requiring little care. Grown primarily for its beautiful foliage which provides color, contrast and texture to the landscape. Dense foliage crowds out most garden weeds. Somewhat stoloniferous. 

May also be listed as Hosta 'Lancifolia'.Genus name honors Austrian botanist Nicholas Thomas Host (1761-1834) and was first established in 1812.  The genus was subsequently renamed in 1817 as Funkia in honor of botanist Heinrich Christian Funk under the belief at that time that Hosta was an invalid name.  Hosta was finally reinstated as the genus name in 1905 by the International Botanical Congress.Specific epithet means with lance-like foliage.Funkia remains a popular common name today in some areas.  An additional common name for plants in this genus is plantain lily (foliage is somewhat plantain-like and flowers are somewhat lily-like in some species).
","
Problems
Although slugs and snails can be serious problems, and leaf spot and crown rot lesser problems, hostas are otherwise virtually disease and pest-free, and are ideal, low-maintenance garden perennials.
","
Garden Uses
A mainstay of the shade garden. This small to medium hosta can be mixed with other perennials in the border or woodland garden, used as an edging plant or massed and divided to create a dense ground cover.

Plants perform best in rich, moist, organic soils, with a preference for consistent moisture during the growing season,  but plants have tolerance for some dry shade once established.  Water is best applied directly to the soil beneath the leaves.  Divide plants as needed in spring or autumn.  Division is usually easiest in early spring before the leaves unfurl.   Hosta ventricosa is one of the few hostas that will come true from seed.  Seeds are produced without fertilization by pseudogamous apomixis which is a form of vegetative reproduction known as agamospermy.   Species plants cannot be used in hybridization as seed parents because the seedlings are simply vegetative clones of the mother plant.  Species plants can serve as pollen parents however.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hosta ventricosa is a large, naturally occurring tetraploid hosta that is native to China and North Korea.  It grows in a rounded mound to 22"" tall spreading to 36"" wide.  Thin, smooth, shiny, cordate, broad-ovate, dark green leaves (9"" by 8"") have widely spaced veins, undulate margins and mucronate tips.  Leaves develop strong ribbing as they mature.  Bell-shaped, purple to violet flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn on upright, leafy, burgundy-spotted, pale green scapes (32-38""). Stearn.Genus name honors Austrian botanist Nicholas Thomas Host (1761-1834) and was first established in 1812.  The genus was subsequently renamed in 1817 as Funkia in honor of botanist Heinrich Christian Funk under the belief at that time that Hosta was an invalid name.  Hosta was finally reinstated as the genus name in 1905 by the International Botanical Congress.Specific epithet means having a swelling on one side.Funkia remains a popular common name today in some areas.  An additional common name for plants in this genus is plantain lily (foliage is somewhat plantain-like and flowers are somewhat lily-like in some species).
","
Problems
Slugs and snails are attracted to the foliage, chewing jagged holes in the leaves, and if left unchecked, can cause serious damage over a fairly short period of time.    Leaf spots and crown rot are less frequent problems.  Otherwise, hostas are virtually pest-free and are considered ideal low-maintenance garden perennials.  Leaves, particularly of exposed plants, can be severely damaged by hail storms.   Leaves of Hosta ventricosa are thin and may scorch along the edges in the hot summers of the deep South even when grown in full shade.
","
Garden Uses
Hostas are a mainstay of shade gardens.  This large mounded hosta makes an interesting garden specimen.  It is also effective in groups or massed.  It can be mixed with other perennials in shady borders, shade gardens or woodland gardens.   Edging.

Culture
Easily grown in humusy, consistently moist to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Variegated cultivars develop best foliage color in full sun. Plants spread invasively by rhizomes and may need to be restrained by soil barriers or planted in areas where fixed structures such as sidewalks or buildings will restrict spread. In water gardens, grow in containers as marginal aquatic plants. Plants tolerate up to 2” of standing water over the crowns. In natural ponds, plants are also often grown in containers sunk into the mud to maintain control and to avoid unwanted invasive spread. Grow as a ground cover in moist, boggy areas.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Houttuynia cordata is a rhizomatous perennial that typically grows 9-15” tall and spreads indefinitely and often vigorously by rhizomes. It is primarily grown as a ground cover in moist to wet areas, including aquatic margins. Species plants feature ovate to cordate dark blue-green leaves (to 3” long) edged with red. Foliage is aromatic when bruised. Tiny, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in 1-1.5” spikes are subtended by four showy white petal-like bracts. Flowers appear in mid to late spring. The plant is eaten in China and Vietnam.Genus name honors Martin (or Maarten) Houttuyn (1720-1794), Dutch naturalist and physician.Specific epithet means heart-shaped for the leaves.‘Chameleon’ (synonymous with ‘Variegata’ and ‘Tricolor’) features green leaves variegated with shades of red, pink, yellow and/or cream on bright red stems.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12. In St. Louis, wax plant is easily grown as a houseplant. It is best grown in a standard, loamy, well-drained potting mix. It may be trained to a small trellis or framework. Site in bright light with at least 1/2 day of direct sun. Tolerant of curtain-filtered sun and bright indirect light. Good light is necessary for flower production. Pots should not be rotated or moved to another location after flower buds appear. Water plants moderately but consistently throughout the growing season, allowing the soils to become nearly dry between water applications. In winter, plants require less bright light, less watering and tolerate night temperatures to 50F degrees. Do not remove the flowering stalk after bloom because new flowers will form on the old spur.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hoya carnosa, commonly called wax plant or honey plant, is a climbing or trailing perennial of the dogbane and milkweed family. In St. Louis, it is typically grown as a houseplant. It grows 2-4’ indoors. Trailing stems will climb counterclockwise around wire or other thin trellis-like structures. Stems will also trail from hanging baskets. Plants feature glossy, elliptic, fleshy, dark green leaves (to 4” long) and tight rounded clusters (umbels) of fragrant white summer flowers. Each tiny flower (to 1/2” diameter) sports a distinctive, star-shaped, red-centered corona. Each cluster may include from 10-30 flowers. Wax plant is native to India, China and Australia. The genus name honors Thomas Hoy, late 18th century gardener to the Duke of Northumberland.Genus name honors Thomas Hoy, late 18th century gardener to the Duke of Northumberland.Specific epithet means fleshy.Common name refers to the waxy flowers and leaves.‘Variegata’ features leaves with creamy white margins and sometimes a pink tinge.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Prefers moist, rich soils, but has some tolerance for drought.  This vine is dioecious (separate male and female plants), so some male plants are needed (if seed is desired) in order for the female plants to produce seed.  Plants die to the ground each winter, but perennial roots survive to send up new growth each spring.  Stems may be pruned to the ground in autumn after a hard frost.   Propagate by cuttings of runners emanating from the crown.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Humulus lupulus, commonly known as common hop, is a dioecious, rhizomatous, twining perennial vine that is grown commercially for harvest of female fruits which are used by breweries to preserve and flavor beer.  It is also an easy-to-grow ornamental plant that can be grown on a variety of support structures.  This vine is native to Europe, southwestern Asia and North America.  Hops grown commercially in the U.S. are the European variety which has now escaped cultivation and naturalized in many areas.  Common hop grows rapidly each year to 15-20' long on rough stems clad with lobed leaves.  Yellow-green male flowers bloom in catkins.  Female flowers and subsequent seeds are born in cone-like structures (strobiles) which mature in late summer to early fall.  Strobiles are typically collected in September-October with the seeds dried for use in the manufacture of beer.  Flowers emit a pine-like fragrance and are attractive to butterflies.Genus name comes from a Medieval name of the hop plant that has apparently been Latinized.Specific epithet literally means small wolf but his plant was was once called willow-wolf as it would be found climbing over willow trees.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Needs a support structure on which to climb. Skin contact may cause dermatitis.
","
Garden Uses
Interesting ornamental vine for growing on trellises, pergolas, arbors and porches.  Incorporate into an herb garden.  Good screen that will rapidly cover unattractive structures.   Needs a support structure on which to grow.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Hyacinthoides non-scripta, commonly called English bluebell, is a bulbous perennial that is native to open woodland areas of western Europe including, of course, England.  Each bulb produces a small clump of linear, strap-shaped, acute-tipped, basal leaves (3-6 per bulb) from which rises in spring (April-May) a 12-15"" tall rigid flower stem topped by an arching terminal, one-sided raceme of 4-16 fragrant, pendant, narrow-tubular, bell-shaped, deep violet blue flowers (each to 3/4"" long).   Each flower has six petals fused together to form a narrow almost straight-sided bell with slightly rolled back petal tips. English  bluebell is very similar to Spanish bluebell except English bluebell has fragrant flowers, arching flowering racemes, and shorter flowering stems.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Prefers organically rich soils. Tolerates some light shade. Plant bulbs 4-6” deep and 4-6” apart in mid fall. Best planted in mass or in clusters (e.g., 6-15 bulbs). Soils should be kept moist (particularly if soils are dry) immediately after planting to encourage root growth. Also keep soils moist during the spring growing season, but taper off moisture after bloom as bulbs head toward dormancy. Promptly remove spent flower spikes so plants do not need to expend energy on seed production. Bulbs are commonly grown in containers, especially when forced for indoor winter bloom.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hyacinthus orientalis, commonly called hyacinth, Dutch hyacinth or garden hyacinth, is a spring flowering bulb that produces spikes of flowers noted for their intense, often overpowering, fragrance. Typically grows 6-10” tall. Each bulb sends up 3-4 strap-shaped green leaves in early spring and a stiff densely flowered spike of extremely fragrant tubular flowers. A very large number of hybrid cultivars are available in commerce under this species name in flower colors including various shades of blue, purple, pink, red and white.Genus name of a god associated with the rebirth of vegetation like Adonis.Specific epithet means from the Orient.NOTE: Images displayed on this page are of hybrid cultivars not the species.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Bulb rot may occur in poorly drained soils. Wear gloves when planting bulbs to avoid possible allergic skin reactions. Flowering often decreases in quality after the first year, and bulbs may need to be replaced every couple of years. Rabbits tend to avoid this plant.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade.  Tolerates full sun only if grown with consistent moisture.  Can adapt to a variety of soil conditions, but intolerant of drought. The foliage tends to decline considerably in dry conditions. Plants may die to the ground in harsh winters.  Bloom occurs on new wood, so plants may be pruned back close to the ground in late winter to revitalize and to encourage vigorous stem growth and best form.  If not pruned back, any weakened and/or damaged stems should be removed in early spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hydrangea arborescens, commonly known as smooth hydrangea or wild hydrangea, is a loosely and widely branched deciduous shrub that typically grows to 3-6’ (less frequently to 10’) tall.  It is native to moist or rocky wooded slopes, ravines, streambanks and bluff bases from New York to Florida west to Iowa, Missouri, Oklahoma and Louisiana.  Gray-brown stems are clad with opposite, broad egg-shaped to rounded, sharply toothed, dark green leaves (2-6” long) with pale green undersides.  Leaves turn yellow in fall.  Tiny white fertile flowers bloom in May-July in flattened hairy clusters (corymbs to 2-6”across).  Scattered continuing flowering may occur throughout summer to September.  A few large sterile flowers usually appear at the cluster margins (usually not enough for a quality lacecap effect).  Flowers give way to dehiscent seed capsules which ripen in October-November.The genus name Hydrangea comes from hydor meaning ""water"" and aggeion meaning ""vessel"", in reference to the cup-like capsular fruit.Specific epithet comes from arbor meaning ""tree"" in reference to the similarity of this shrub to a small tree.
","
Problems
Many species of hydrangea, including this one, are susceptible to bud blight, bacterial wilt, leaf spots, mold, rust and powdery mildew.  Watch for aphids, mites, scale and nematodes.  Pruning stems back to the ground in late winter each year helps promote stem vigor. Rabbits tend to avoid this plant.
","

Culture
Hydrangea macrophylla is best grown in rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade.  Tolerates full sun only if grown in consistently moist soils.  Soil pH affects the flower color of most cultivars except white (blue in highly acidic soils and lilac to pink in slightly acidic to alkaline soils).  Add aluminum sulfate to the soil to make the flowers bluer or add lime to the soil to make the flowers pinker.  Begin soil treatments well in advance of flowering, as in late autumn or early spring.  Plants generally need little pruning.  If needed, prune immediately after flowering by cutting back flowering stems to a pair of healthy buds.  Prune out weak or winter-damaged stems in late winter/early spring.  Best to mulch plants year-round with 3"" of shredded  bark, peat or compost.  Winter hardy to USDA Zone 6. For added protection, however, plants grown in USDA Zone 5 should be sited in sheltered locations and given additional winter protection, as needed, for the purposes of minimizing the risk of loss of significant numbers of flower buds or possible die-back to the ground in an extremely harsh winter.  A burlap wrap of stems or circle of chicken wire filled with leaves or straw to 8-12"" are time-consuming and visually unattractive landscape options, but can be effective.  Regardless of protective measures taken, most bigleaf hydrangeas simply will not bloom (or will bloom poorly) in some years because of a variety of winter occurrences beyond the control of the gardener (e.g. low temperatures, sudden wide temperature fluctuations, icy conditions, late frosts). Some newer cultivars have been selected that flower on both old and new wood. Their pruning and flowering can differ from that of the species.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hydrangea macrophylla, commonly called big leaf hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub with a rounded habit that, in the St. Louis area, typically grows 3-6’ tall and as wide unless damaged by harsh winters or pruned smaller.  It generally features serrate, obovate to elliptic, dark green leaves (4-8” long) and large clusters of long-blooming summer flowers in either lacecap form (flattened flower clusters of small fertile florets with scattered showy sterile florets often forming a marginal ring) or mophead form (globose flower clusters of mostly showy sterile florets).The genus name Hydrangea comes from hydor meaning ""water"" and aggeion meaning ""vessel"", in reference to the cup-like capsular fruit.Specific epithet comes from the Greek words makros meaning large and phyllon meaning leaf in reference to plant leaves.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11. In the St. Louis area, plants may be grown in greenhouses or outdoors during the growing season with indoor overwintering. For outdoor use, site plants in moderately fertile wet loams in pond margins or in soil bottoms that are 6-10” below the water surface. Container may also be placed on the soil bottom. Best growth usually occurs in approximately 6” of water. Plants sited in pond margins will send out floating stems into the water. Propagate by dividing off floating stems that have produced roots (rooted plantlets). Plants may be grown from seed, although seed is often difficult to harvest. Sow the seed in shallow pans, sprinkle sand on top and submerge the pans in 1-2” of still water. If overwintering is desired, bring plants indoors before first frost to a shallow tub or aquarium in strong light.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hydrocleys nymphoides, commonly called water poppy, is a deciduous, stoloniferous, aquatic perennial. It is native to Central and South America, but has been introduced into and naturalized in some areas of Florida and Texas. It features shiny, thick, rounded, dark green leaves (2-4”) that typically float on, but occasionally rise above, the water surface. Leaves have heart-shaped bases. Single, 3-petaled, yellow flowers (2” diameter) with reddish-brown centers and numerous black or brown stamens rise up above the water surface. Plants flower in summer in water that has reached at least 70F. Flowers typically last only one day, but plants bloom in succession over a long summer period. Plants send out floating plant runners on the water surface that sprout new foliage and roots. Flowers are most frequently produced on the runners. Plants provide good surface cover. In St. Louis, water poppy is not invasive, but in warm winter climates not subject to frost it can become somewhat weedy.Genus name comes from the Greek words hydor meaning water and kleis meaning a key.Specific epithet means resembling the genus Nymphaea.

Best grown in consistently moist, well-drained soils in a light shady spot.  Can grow aggressively in optimum conditions.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hydrophyllum virginianum, commonly called Virginia waterleaf, is an upright perennial of the waterleaf family that grows to 12-24” tall.  It is native to moist to wet woods from Quebec to Manitoba south to Oklahoma, Tennessee and North Carolina.  In Missouri, it is typically found in low woods, thickets, ravine bottoms, bluff bases, river flood plains and stream valleys (Steyermark).  

Tiny, white to lilac, bell-shaped flowers (1/3” long) bloom from May to June (sometimes with infrequent additional bloom to August) in rounded clusters (terminal cymes to 2” across containing 8-20 flowers) atop long stalks extending from the upper leaf axils beyond the leaves.  Flower petals are fused into a tiny bell, with the hairy, white-filamented stamens emerging from and extending well beyond the rim of the bell.  

Long-stalked lower leaves (6-10” long) are deeply divided into 5 to 7 sharply and coarsely toothed green leaflets (deep lobes) which are usually mottled with blotches resembling watermarks.  Leaflets on the upper leaves are not as deeply cut.  

Root tea was once used as an astringent to stop bleeding and for diarrhea and dysentery.  Roots have been used as a mild emetic to cause vomiting.  Tea or mashed roots were once used to treat cracked lips and mouth sores.Genus name comes from the Greek words hydor meaning water and phyllon meaning leaf in reference to markings on plant leaves which give the appearance of being water spots.Specific epithet is in reference to Virginia being part of the native territory for this plant.Common name of waterleaf is in reference to the whitish leaf spots which resemble water stains.  

Additional common names for this plant include John’s cabbage and Shawnee salad, both of which are in reference to the young leaves and shoots which are edible and may be added to salads.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Hylotelephium is a genus of about 33 species of drought-tolerant herbaceous perennials native to Asia, Europe, and North America. They are commonly called stonecrop and are excellent plants for fall gardens. Many species and hybrids were formerly place in the genus Sedum.Genus name probably honor Telephus, King of Mysia and son of Hercules.Many hylotelephiums and sedums are commonly called stonecrop in reference to the frequent sighting of the genus in the wild growing on rocks or stony ledges.A clump-forming perennial that features masses of tiny, star-like, bright pink flowers in large, 3-6"" across, flattened heads (cymes) atop stems of fleshy, succulent-like, variegated yellow and green leaves growing in upright to slightly spreading clumps typically to 18"" tall. Leaves may revert to green. Commonly called stonecrop in reference to the frequent sighting of the genus in the wild growing on rocks or stony ledges. Attractive to butterflies and bees. Long late summer to fall bloom period. Foliage is effective throughout the growing season. Formerly known and sometimes still referred to as Sedum spectabile 'Variegatum'. May also be sold as Sedum spectabile var. alboroseum 'Mediovariegatum'.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hylotelephium spectabile, commonly known as hylotelephium, showy stonecrop, live-forever, ice plant or orpine, is a succulent herbaceous perennial which typically grows in an upright to semi-upright mound on unbranched stems typically rising to 18-24” tall. It features (a) fleshy, flat, coarsely-toothed, elliptic, opposite (sometimes in whorls of 3-4), dull green to blue-green leaves (to 3” long), (b) fleshy stems and (c) tiny, star-like, pink flowers (to 1/2” across) which bloom from late summer to frost (August-October) in dense rounded flower heads (corymbose cymes to 3-4” across).  Flower color fades to burgundy brown as the flowers age.  Upper leaves are sessile.  This plant is native from eastern Europe to China and Japan, but has been introduced in many other parts of the world including areas of the U.S. where it has escaped gardens and naturalized in some eastern and central States including New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, Georgia, Wisconsin and Louisiana.  

This plant was formerly known by the synonymous name of Sedum spectabile, and continues to be listed and sold in commerce by some nurseries under this name. However, at one point in the recent past, some of the taller sedums, including Sedum spectabile, were separated from the genus Sedum by some authorities and assigned to the genus Hylotelephium.  

Although the straight species is uncommonly sold, a large number of cultivars and hybrids are popularly sold and commonly available in commerce.Genus name probably honor Telephus, King of Mysia and son of Hercules.Specific epithet from Latin means spectacular or showy.Common name of stonecrop is in reference to the fact that many hylotelephiums and sedums are typically found in the wild growing on rocky or stony ledges.  Common name of live-forever is in reference to the vigorous and persistent characteristics of this plant which is easy to grow (will regenerate from a single leaf) and whose mature foliage will remain for some time on cut stems or uprooted plants without falling off.  Common name of orpine comes from the Old French word orpiment in reference to an ancient variety of Sedum.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Hylotelephium telephium, commonly known as stonecrop, orpine or live-forever, is a succulent herbaceous perennial which typically grows in an upright to semi-upright mound on unbranched stems rising to 18-24” tall.  It is often hybridized with a similar upright species known as Hylotelephium spectabile (e.g., see H. AUTUMN JOY), but is primarily distinguished from H. spectabile by its alternate leaves (H. spectabile leaves are opposite or in whorls of 3-4).  It features (a) fleshy, flat, coarsely-toothed, elliptic, alternate (but sometimes opposite on axillary shoots), dull green to blue-green leaves (to 3” long), (b) fleshy stems and (c) tiny, star-like, pink to reddish purple  flowers (to 1/2” across) which bloom from late summer to frost (August-October) in dense rounded flower heads (corymbose cymes to 3-4” across).  Flower color fades to burgundy brown as the flowers age.  Upper leaves are sessile.  Foliage and dead inflorescences often persist into winter providing some additional interest.  This plant is native from eastern Europe to China and Japan, but has been introduced into many other parts of the world including Canada and the U.S. where it has escaped gardens and naturalized in a number of areas from Quebec to Saskatchewan plus the Yukon territory and from Maine to Minnesota south to Kansas, Alabama, and North Carolina plus Washington and Idaho.

Culture
Reliably winter hardy to USDA Zone 10-11. Plants are best grown in humusy, fertile, consistently moist to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Soils must never be allowed to dry out. For outdoor gardens, plant bulbs 4” deep and space 8-12” apart in mid-spring. For containers, plant bulbs in spring with the necks of the bulbs slightly above the soil surface. In St. Louis, bulbs or plants must be overwintered indoors. There are two options for overwintering: (1) Dig the bulbs in fall before first frost, let the surface dry then store them in dry peat at 55-69F, or (2) Bring plants indoors in containers as houseplants before the first fall frost, placing the containers in humid locations of at least 60F with watering reduced to the minimum necessary to prevent foliage wilting.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hymenocallis latifolia is native to southern Florida and the West Indies. It is grown primarily for its showy white flowers. This is an evergreen bulbous perennial that typically grows to 2-3’ tall. Each bulb produces a basal clump of arching, linear, strap-shaped leaves (each leaf to 2 1/2’ long). In summer, leafless flowering stalks (scapes) rise from the foliage clump. Each scape is topped by an umbel of 10-16 fragrant, white, spidery flowers that rise well above the foliage. Each flower has six narrow, spidery perianth segments (to 5”) and a daffodil-like, 3-inch staminal center cup (corona). Plants in the genus Hymenocallis are commonly called spider lily, basket lily and Peruvian daffodil.Genus name comes from the Greek words hymen meaning a membrane and kallos meaning beauty in allusion to the membrane uniting the stamens.Specific epithet means with broad leaves.

Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Snails, caterpillars and mealy bugs are occasional visitors.

Culture
This spider lily is best grown in humusy, fertile, consistently moist to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Plants will grow in up to 2"" of standing water and will tolerate seasonal flooding, but will also perform well in moist upland soils. Soils must never be allowed to dry out. Plant bulbs in the garden in early spring with tips located about 1-3"" below the soil surface. Space bulbs 12-24"" apart. Bulbs may be grown in containers as above-ground container plants or with containers sunk into the soil to facilitate easier bulb removal for indoor overwintering. For containers, plant bulbs in spring with the necks of the bulbs slightly above the soil surface. Remove foliage after it turns brown (late summer). In USDA Zones 7-10, bulbs may remain in the ground over winter. North of USDA Zone 7 (which includes St. Louis), bulbs must be overwintered indoors, by either (1) digging the bulbs in fall before first frost with retention roots, drying them out and then storing them in dry peat at 55-69F, or (2) bringing containers indoors before the first fall frost and overwintering the containers in cool dry locations of 55-60 degrees F.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Hymenocallis liriosme is native to marsh and pond margins, swamps, alluvial woods and ditches from eastern Texas and Oklahoma to Alabama. It is a bulbous perennial of the amaryllis family that is grown primarily for its showy, sweetly fragrant, wide-spreading, white flowers. Plants typically grow to 1.5- 2' tall. Flowers bloom in summer atop leafless scapes rising from a basal clump of arching, linear, narrow, strap-shaped, glossy green leaves (each typically 1-3' long and to 1"" wide). Each long-tubed flower (to 7"" wide) features six narrow, spidery, petal-like segments (tepals) which radiate outward from a central, spreading, white staminal cup (corona) with a yellowish-green eye. Stamens rise up from the central cup. This species is also known as western marsh spider lily.Genus name comes from the Greek words hymen meaning a membrane and kallos meaning beauty in allusion to the membrane uniting the stamens.Specific epithet means fragrant lily.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Plants of this species are noted for their shade tolerance, however too much shade decreases flower production. Prefers rich, loamy, acidic soils. Mulch roots in winter. Top growth is not reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5 where plants may suffer tip dieback or die entirely to the ground in harsh winters. When plants die to the ground in winter, the roots often survive and send up new shoots in spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hypericum androsaemum, commonly called tutsan or sweet-amber, is a small, spreading, deciduous shrub that is native from western Europe, southern Europe and North Africa to Iran. It freely self-seeds in the landscape. It is considered to be somewhat weedy in Europe, but invasively weedy in Australia and New Zealand. It has naturalized along the U.S. Pacific coast, but is not at this time considered to be invasive in that area. It typically grows to 2-3’ tall with erect branches densely clad with ovate to oblong medium green leaves (to 4” long). Star or cup shaped, 5-petaled, golden yellow flowers (3/4” diameter) with center clumps of bushy yellow stamens bloom in cymes of 3-9 in summer. Flowers are followed by spherical red fruits that mature to black. Birds are attracted to the fruits and help spread the seed to other locations.Genus name comes from the Greek words hyper meaning above and eikon meaning picture in reference to the practice of hanging flowers from this genus above images, pictures or windows.Specific epithet comes from the Greek words andro (man) and haima (blood) in reference to the reddish (blood-like) plant sap.Common name of tutsan comes from the French words toute (all) and saine (healthy) in reference to various old medicinal uses for species plants, particularly the roots. Sweet-amber is in reference to the plant's ambergris aroma.
","
Problems
Wilt and root rot can be troublesome, particularly in hot and humid climates of the South. Leaf spot, mildew and rust are less threatening. Susceptible to nematodes which can cause root rot. Watch for thrips and scale.
","
Garden Uses
Low hedge or edger. Excellent for mass planting. Wood margins, slopes and naturalized areas. Fruit-laden stems are treasured for cut flower arrangements.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Tolerates wide range of soil conditions. Evergreen in warm winter climates of the South, but acts more like a woody perennial in the North where it often dies to the ground in cold winter climates. In USDA Zone 5, it may be best to cut stems back to the ground each year in early spring (as with buddleias). Blooms on new growth.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hypericum beanii is a compact, deciduous shrub which typically grows to 3' tall in the South, but grows closer to 1.5-2' tall in colder climates where it is usually cut to the ground or naturally dies to the ground each winter. Features rose-like, 5-petaled, golden yellow flowers (to 2"" diameter) with prominent, bushy, dark yellow center stamens. Flowers bloom from July to September. Oblong, light green leaves (to 2.5"" long) appear on willowy stems. Formerly know as H. patulum var. henryi.Genus name comes from the Greek words hyper meaning above and eikon meaning picture in reference to the practice of hanging flowers from this genus above images, pictures or windows.Specific epithet honors William Jackson Bean (1863-1947), curator at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.Plants of the genus Hypericum (some of which have been used since ancient times in the treatment of wounds and inflammations) were apparently gathered and burned to ward off evil spirits on the eve of St. John's Day, thus giving rise to the genus common name.

Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Tolerates wide range of soils. Thrives on sandy soils in full sun. Less floriferous in part shade. Evergreen in warm winter climates. Usually dies to the ground or suffers some tip dieback in cold winter climates, but blooms on new growth and comes back nicely each spring. In areas where it does not die in winter, shear or mow plants in late winter or early spring every 2-3 years to renew and induce new growth. Spreads rapidly by underground stems and can spread aggressively in ideal growing conditions. Plant 18"" apart for use as a ground cover.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hypericum calycinum is a stoloniferous subshrub or shrublet, typically growing 12"" (less frequently to 18"") high and 24"" wide, which is frequently planted as a ground cover. Features large, rose-like, 5-petaled, yellow flowers (2-3"" diameter) having numerous, bushy stamens with reddish anthers. Flowers appear singly or in groups of 2-3 and cover the plant in summer. Oval to oblong, distinctively net-veined (from beneath) leaves (to 4"" long) are rich green in sun but are a lighter, yellowish green in shade. Four-angled stems are both procumbent and ascending. Sometimes commonly called Aaron's beard or creeping St. John's wort.Genus name comes from the Greek words hyper meaning above and eikon meaning picture in reference to the practice of hanging flowers from this genus above images, pictures or windows.Specific epithet means calyx-like.Plants of the genus Hypericum (some species have been used since ancient times in the treatment of wounds) were apparently gathered and burned to ward off evil spirits on the eve of St. John's Day, thus giving rise to the genus common name of St. John's wort.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems of a frequently occurring nature. Wilt and root rot can be significant problems, particularly in hot and humid climates of the South.
","
Garden Uses
Mass as a ground cover. Rock gardens, border fronts, naturalized plantings. Edger for open woodland gardens. Also effective massed on slopes, hillsides or embankments for stabilizing soils. Plant under trees where it competes well with shallow tree roots. Allan Armitage calls the species ""one of the finest ground covers available"".

Noteworthy Characteristics
Hypericum kalmianum, commonly called Kalm St. Johns wort, is a small, dense, evergreen shrub or subshrub with upright branching that typically grows in a dense mound to 2-3’ tall. It is native to the Great Lakes region of the U.S. where it typically occurs in rocky to sandy soils, ranging from relatively dry open woods to moist lakeshore areas. Narrow, linear-oblong, stalkless, bluish-green leaves (to 2” long) in pairs on distinctive 4-angled stems are evergreen but some may drop in winter. Five-petaled, golden yellow flowers (1.5-inch diameter) in 3- to 7-flowered cymes bloom in mid to late summer (July-August). Each flower has five styles and a distinctive center boss of yellow stamens. Flowers give way to beaked, oval, brown seed capsules that mature in fall and often persist on the shrub until spring. Leaves are dotted with tiny glands.Genus name comes from the Greek words hyper meaning above and eikon meaning picture in reference to the practice of hanging flowers from this genus above images, pictures or windows.Specific epithet honors Peter Kalm, a student of Linnaeus, who reportedly discovered this plant in the wild in North America in the mid-1700s.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hypericum lissophloeus, commonly known as smooth-barked St. Johnswort, is a narrow, upright, sparsely-branched, asparagus-like evergreen shrub with a tree-like character that typically grows to 6-10’ tall and to 3-5’ wide.  It is native to well-drained sandy soils on the slopes and margins of sink hole ponds and lakes located in an area of xeric uplands in Bay and Washington Counties on the Florida panhandle.  It is listed as an endangered species in the State of Florida.  Dramatic water fluxuations occur in the areas of these sink holes during the course of a year ranging from periodic episodes of drought to swampy conditions including seasonal flooding with standing water to as much as 4’ deep.  Shrubs growing in water often develop woody interlaced prop roots.  Distinguishing features of this shrub include (1) smooth chestnut brown exfoliating bark, (2) needle-like gray-green leaves (to 1” long), (3) 5-petaled bright yellow flowers (to 1/ 2” across) which bloom in summer in 1-3 flowered inflorescences, and (4) multi-seeded capsules.Genus name comes from the Greek words hyper meaning above and eikon meaning picture in reference to the practice of hanging flowers from this genus above images, pictures or windows.Specific epithet comes from the Greek words lisso meaning smooth and phloeus meaning bark in commemoration of the bark found on this shrub which triggered adoption of the “smooth-barked” part of the common name.

Culture
Easily grown in medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Species plants prefer sandy or gravelly soils in sunny areas.  They tolerate some drought once established.  They develop extensive root systems, and spread by both runners and often prolific self-seeding.  A single plant may produce up to 100,000 seeds per year.  Seeds buried in soil may last for 10 years.  Species plants are listed as noxious weeds in California, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hypericum perforatum, St. John’s wort (sometimes commonly called perforate St. John's wort, goatweed or Klamath weed) is an upright, many-branched, stoloniferous, yellow-flowered, herbaceous perennial (some say perennial weed) that is native to Europe, western Asia and northern Africa.  Plants were first brought to North America by settlers in 1696, and have  naturalized over time throughout much of the continent.  In Missouri, this species is now found in scattered locations throughout the State primarily in fields, waste ground, pastures, railroad right-of-ways and along roads (Steyermark).  It typically grows from a woody, branched rootstock to 1-3’ tall, and features a showy display of star-shaped, yellow flowers (1 1/2” diameter) that bloom in pyramidal compound cymes in summer (June-August).  Each flower has 5 yellow petals peppered with black dots, a pistil with 3 styles and a center boss of bushy yellow stamens.  Stem-clasping, elliptic to oblong leaves to (1 1/4” long) have translucent dots and black marginal punctations.  Foliage has an unpleasant aroma when bruised or rubbed.  

Since ancient times, hypericum plants have been used as herbal treatments for a variety of medical problems including externally for wounds, inflammations, burns, skin disorders, and nerve pain and internally for anxiety, depression and insomnia.  The flowers were at one point gathered and displayed to ward off evil spirits. Flowers are typically in bloom on the birthday of St. John the Baptist (June 24).  Wort is a name often given to a healing plant. The active ingredient in the leaves and flowers is hypercin.Genus name comes from the Greek words hyper meaning above and eikon meaning picture in reference to the practice of hanging flowers from this genus above images, pictures or windows.Specific epithet is in reference to the perforated appearance of the leaves (from the translucent dots).Additional common names include goatweed or Klamath weed (plant was first discovered growing in the wild in California near the Klamath River).

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hypericum prolificum, commonly called  shrubby St. John's wort, is a Missouri native plant that occurs on rocky ground, dry wooded slopes, uncultivated fields, gravel bars along streams and in low, moist valleys. A compact, deciduous, rounded shrub with an erect habit that typically grows 1-4' (less frequently to 5') tall. Features 5-petaled, bright yellow flowers (to 1"" diameter) with numerous, yellow stamens. Stamens are bushy to the point of partially obscuring the petals (hence the species name of prolificum which refers to the stamens). Flowers appear in terminal or axillary clusters (cymes) from early to mid summer. Dark green, lance-shaped leaves are 2-3"" long. Cone-shaped seed capsules split in autumn to release black seeds. Bark of older stems exfoliates to reveal attractive, pale orange inner bark. Steyermark lists this plant as Hypericum spathulatum.Genus name comes from the Greek words hyper meaning above and eikon meaning picture in reference to the practice of hanging flowers from this genus above images, pictures or windows.Specific epithet means many or prolific in reference to the many stamens.Plants of the genus Hypericum (some species have been used since ancient times in the treatment of wounds and inflammations) were apparently gathered and burned to ward off evil spirits on the eve of St. John's Day, thus giving rise to the genus common name of St. John's wort.
","
Problems
Root rot and wilt can be significant problems in hot and humid climates.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. In St. Louis, plants are grown as bedding annuals or in containers. Bedding plants are best grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade. Pinch tips to promote bushiness. Some gardeners remove flower spikes because they are somewhat inconspicuous and tend to detract from the attractive foliage. Overwinter containers and grow houseplants in bright indoor light, but not direct sun. Although bedding plants can be dug and potted up in fall for overwintering, it may be easier to simply purchase new plants each spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hypoestes phyllostachya, commonly called polka dot plant, is native to Madagascar. It is an evergreen tropical subshrub that is noted for its ovate green leaves (to 2” long) which are spotted with rose, pink or lavender. As a bedding plan or houseplant, it typically grows like an herbaceous perennial to 12-20” tall. Tiny lilac flowers in racemes to 6” long bloom sporadically in the summer.Genus name comes from the Greek hypo meaning under and estia meaning a house for the calyxes being covered by bracts.

Culture
Easily grown in average, dry to medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Generally appreciates some afternoon part shade in hot summer climates. Thrives with regular watering, but established plants have respectable drought tolerance. Plants perform well in poor soils including dry, sandy ones, but generally prefer well-draining, fertile loams. Prune back foliage in early to mid-spring. May be grown from seed sown in early spring. Plants will self-seed in the garden. Plants are evergreen subshrubs in warm winter climates. Propagate by division in spring, cuttings or seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Hyssopus officinalis, commonly called hyssop, is an aromatic, semi-evergreen, woody-based, shrubby perennial that grows in an erect bushy clump to 18-24” tall. It is frequently grown in herb gardens and as an ornamental. It is native to the northern Mediterranean coast and Asia Minor, but has naturalized along roads in some parts of the U.S. It features narrow, stalkless, toothed, aromatic, shiny dark green leaves (to 1” long). Fragrant, two-lipped, tubular, purple-blue flowers with protruding stamens bloom in whorls on long dense terminal spikes in mid to late summer. Foliage, flowers and plant oils have a long history of culinary and folk medicine uses. Leaves have been and still are used in cooking to flavor such things as meats, soups, sauces, salads or stews. Hyssop oil is currently used as a flavoring agent in Chartreuse liquor. Plants are attractive to bees and butterflies.Genus name comes from the classical name for this sweet herb adapted from a Semitic plant name ezob.Specific epithet means sold in shops. Applied to plants of real or supposed medicinal properties.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.
","
Garden Uses
Herb garden, rock garden or border. Specimen or group. Clip for low hedge or edger. Containers. Leaves and flowers may be harvested for use in cooking or dried for use in potpourris.

Culture
Typically grown in medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Less floriferous if grown in part shade.  Well-drained soil is the key to growing this plant well.  Tolerant of drought.  Cut or sheer plants stems back by 1/3 after flowering to encourage new growth and to maintain compact habit.  In cold winter climates, mulch plants with a modest covering of evergreen boughs in winter to help minimize potential damage from sun scorch and desiccation.  Plant foliage often benefits in winter from snow cover.  Stems may root where they touch the ground creating new plants which can be left as is or transplanted to other areas.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Iberis sempervirens, commonly called candytuft, is a low-growing, spreading, woody-based, herbaceous perennial or sub-shrub which typically forms a foliage mound rising to 6-12” tall and spreading to 18” wide or more.  It is native to southern Europe.  It is evergreen in warm winter climates, but semi-evergreen in cold winter climates where the foliage may become straggly or otherwise suffer significant decline in harsh winters.  Small, pure white, 4-petaled flowers in dense, flattened clusters (corymbs) appear in a profuse, early-to-late-spring bloom (March-May), the density of which often totally obscures the foliage beneath.  Flowers sometimes gradually age to light pink.  Numerous, oblong, entire, narrow, dark green, leathery leaves (1-1.5” long).Genus name comes from the Greek word iberis indicating a plant from Iberia.Specific epithet comes from semper meaning ""always"" and folia meaning ""green"" in reference to the evergreen foliage of this species.
","
Problems
Wet, poorly-drained soils inevitably lead to crown rot which can devastate plantings.  Susceptible to club root which results in stunted growth.  Desiccation and sun scorch may damage the evergreen foliage in cold winter climates.  Additional potential problems include downy mildew, powdery mildew, gray mold, rust and fungal leaf spots.  Watch for slugs, snails and caterpillars. Deer and rabbits tend to avoid this plant.
","
Garden Uses
Excellent edging for borders, paths or walkways.  Rock gardens.  Sprawl over a wall.  Interesting ground cover for small, sunny areas.  Containers.

Culture
Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best in locations protected from cold winter winds. Part afternoon shade is best in hot summer climates. Avoid poorly drained soils. Prune in winter if needed. Plants of this species are dioecious (separate male and female plants). Female plants need a male pollinator in the area in order to bear fruit. This species can be difficult to grow in the St. Louis area because it dislikes cold winters (not considered winter hardy in USDA Zone 5 and the northern part of USDA Zone 6) and also dislikes hot and humid summers. It grows much better in the climate of the Pacific Northwest where it has naturalized.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ilex aquifolium, commonly called English holly, is native to Europe, western Asia and north Africa.  It is an erect, pyramidal, densely-branched, evergreen tree that typically grows to 30-50’ (less frequently to 80’) tall.  It also may be trained and grown as a large shrub (10-15’ tall).  Elliptic, leathery, glossy, wavy-margined, evergreen, dark green leaves (1-3” long) have large spiny teeth.  Greenish-white flowers appear in May.  Flowers are fragrant but generally inconspicuous.  Pollinated flowers give way to berry-like red (less frequently orange or yellow) drupes (1/4” diameter) which ripen in fall and persist into winter.  Birds are attracted to the fruit.Genus name comes from the Latin name Quercus ilex for holm oak in reference to the foliage similarities (holm oak and many of the shrubs in the genus Ilex have evergreen leaves).Specific epithet comes from the Latin word acus meaning needle and folium meaning leaf in reference to the spiny leaves.
",,"
Garden Uses
By reputation, English holly is a better ornamental tree than American holly (see I. opaca), but it has less winter hardiness and is more difficult to grow in the lower Midwest and deep South. Effective as a specimen or in small groups. Foundation plantings. Foliage and fruit provide good color for the winter landscape. Tall hedge.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ilex cornuta, commonly called Chinese holly, is native to China and Korea. It has naturalized from garden plantings in North Carolina and Alabama. It is a broadleaf evergreen that typically grows as a shrub to 8-10’ tall, but may be trained as a small tree to as much as 25’ tall. Unusually shaped rectangular leaves (to 4” long) have three large spines at the apex. Dull white flowers appear in May. Flowers are fragrant but generally inconspicuous. Pollinated flowers give way to berry-like red drupes (1/3” long) which ripen in fall and persist into winter. Birds are attracted to the fruit.Genus name comes from the Latin name Quercus ilex for holm oak in reference to the foliage similarities (holm oak and many of the shrubs in the genus Ilex have evergreen leaves).Specific epithet means horn or horn-shaped.
","
Problems
Potential insect problems include holly leaf miner, spider mites, whitefly and scale. Potential disease problems include leaf spot, leaf rot, tar spot and powdery mildew. Plants are also susceptible to leaf drop, leaf scorch and chlorosis (yellowing of leaves in high pH soils). Winter hardiness is a significant problem in St. Louis.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ilex decidua is a Missouri native, deciduous holly that is commonly called possum haw. It occurs on limestone glades and bluffs, along streams in wet woods, and in lowland valleys, sloughs and swamps. An upright shrub with a spreading, rounded crown which typically grows 7-15' tall in cultivation (to 30' in the wild). Obovate, narrow, glossy, dark green leaves (2-3"" long) turn a dull purplish green to yellow in autumn. The whitish flowers of both male and female plants are relatively inconspicuous. Pollinated female flowers give way to orange-red berries which ripen in September and persist throughout the winter until mid-March when new growth begins. Birds, deer and a variety of small mammals (including opossums as the common name suggests) are attracted to the fruit.Genus name comes from the Latin name Quercus ilex for holm oak in reference to the foliage similarities (holm oak and many of the shrubs in the genus Ilex have evergreen leaves).Specific epithet refers to the species being deciduous not evergreen like most hollies.

Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Adaptable to both light and heavy soils. Tolerates wet soils. Prefers rich, consistently moist, acidic soils in full sun. Good shade tolerance, however. Avoid neutral to alkaline soils. Inkberries are dioecious (separate male and female plants). Female plants need a male pollinator in order to produce the berry-like drupes that are characteristic of the species and cultivars. Prune to shape in early spring just before new growth begins. Plants generally need minimal pruning unless used as a hedge (perhaps best grown as an informal hedge). Remove root suckers regularly if colonial spread is not desired.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ilex glabra, commonly called inkberry or gallberry, is a slow-growing, upright-rounded, stoloniferous, broadleaf evergreen shrub in the holly family. It typically matures to 5-8’ tall, and can spread by root suckers to form colonies. It is native to the coastal plain from Nova Scotia to Florida to Louisiana where it is most commonly found in sandy woods and peripheries of swamps and bogs. Spineless, flat, ovate to elliptic, glossy, dark green leaves (to 1.5” long) have smooth margins with several marginal teeth near the apex. Leaves usually remain attractive in winter unless temperatures dip well below zero. Greenish white flowers (male in cymes and female in cymes or single) appear in spring, but are relatively inconspicuous. If pollinated, female flowers give way to pea-sized, jet black, berry-like drupes (inkberries to 3/8"" diameter) which mature in early fall and persist throughout winter to early spring unless consumed by local bird populations. Gallberry honey is a highly-rated honey that results from bees feeding on inkberry flowers. This honey is locally produced in certain parts of the Southeastern U.S. in areas where beekeepers release bees from late April to early June to coincide with inkberry flowering time. Dried and roasted inkberry leaves were first used by Native Americans to brew a black tea-like drink, hence the sometimes used common name of Appalachian tea for this shrub.Genus name comes from the Latin name Quercus ilex for holm oak in reference to the foliage similarities (holm oak and many of the shrubs in the genus Ilex have evergreen leaves).Specific epithet means smooth in reference to plant leaf surfaces.Cultivars of species plants (see for example Ilex glabra 'Shamrock') typically have better form (more compact, less open, less leggy and less suckering) that the species.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Leaf spot is an occasional problem. Spider mites may appear, especially in dry conditions. Susceptible to chlorosis (yellowing of leaves) in high pH (alkaline) soils.
","
Garden Uses
Mass or group. Excellent for shrub borders, foundation plantings or as a low hedge. Also effective naturalized in moist woodland gardens or in moist locations near streams or ponds. This species is noted for its ability to perform well in wet sites.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ilex opaca, commonly called American holly, is an upright, pyramidal, evergreen tree that slowly matures to 15-30' in cultivation, but may reach 50' tall in the wild.  It is native to the eastern and central U.S., most frequently found in moist woods, forest bottomlands and swamp peripheries plus some coastal dunes (e.g., Cape Cod down the Atlantic Coast) from Massachusetts to West Virginia to Ohio to southeastern Missouri south to Texas and Florida.  This species is easily identified because it is the only native U.S. holly with spiny green leaves and bright red berries.  This is the Christmas holly whose berry-laden boughs are typically collected at Christmas time each year for ornamentation (""decking the halls"" as it were).  Thick, leathery, deep green leaves (2-4"" long) have spiny marginal teeth.  Species is dioecious (male and female flowers are on separate trees).  Greenish-white flowers bloom May-June (male flowers in 3-12 flowered clusters and female flowers solitary or in 2s or 3s).  Bright red or orange fruits (drupes to 1/4- 1/2"" diameter) ripen in fall on pollinated female trees, and persist on the tree through winter.  Birds love the fruit.Genus name comes from the Latin name Quercus ilex for holm oak in reference to the foliage similarities (holm oak and many of the shrubs in the genus Ilex have evergreen leaves).Specific epithet means opaque or dull, in reference to the non-lustrous leaf surfaces of species plants (many of the cultivars have more lustrous foliage).
","
Problems
Potential insect problems include holly leaf miner, spider mites, whitefly and scale.  Potential disease problems include leaf spot, leaf rot, tar spot and powdery mildew.  Plants are also susceptible to leaf drop, leaf scorch and chlorosis (yellowing of leaves in high pH soils).

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ilex pedunculosa is a broadleaved, evergreen shrub or small multi-trunked tree which typically grows to 15' tall (infrequently to 30'). Features narrow, entire (untoothed), pear-like, glossy green leaves (1-3"" long). Foliage may acquire a yellowish tinge in harsh winters. The greenish white flowers of both male and female plants appear in June and are relatively inconspicuous. Pollinated female flowers produce 1/4"" diameter red berries in autumn which dangle on long stalks (to 1.5"") and persist into late autumn or early winter. The distinctive berry stalks of this plant give rise to both the common name and the species name (berry stalk is known as a peduncle). Birds are attracted to the fruit.Genus name comes from the Latin name Quercus ilex for holm oak in reference to the foliage similarities (holm oak and many of the shrubs in the genus Ilex have evergreen leaves).Specific epithet means with a well-developed (long) flower stalk.

Ilex verticillata, commonly called winterberry, is a deciduous holly that is native to eastern North America where it typically occurs in swamps, damp thickets, low woods and along ponds and streams.  The form of this plant found in Missouri is Ilex verticillata var. padifolia, which occurs in “shut-ins”, granite rocky stream beds and sandstone bluffs in only 4 counties in the southeastern part of the state (Steyermark).  This is a slow-growing, deciduous shrub with an upright-rounded habit that typically grows 3-12’ tall.  In the wild, it often suckers to form large thickets or colonies.  Elliptic to obovate, toothed, dark green leaves (2-3” long).  Fall color is usually negligible, but in some years leaves may turn attractive shades of maroon.  Relatively inconspicuous greenish-white flowers appear in the leaf axils in late spring.  Flowers, if properly pollinated, give way to a crop of bright red berries (1/4” diameter) in late summer to fall.  Berries are quite showy and will persist throughout the winter (hence the common name) and often into early spring.  Berries provide considerable impact and interest to the winter landscape.Genus name comes from the Latin name Quercus ilex for holm oak in reference to the foliage similarities (holm oak and many of the shrubs in the genus Ilex have evergreen leaves).Specific epithet from Latin means whorled in reference to the arrangement of sessile fruits in pseudo-whorls around the stems.Common name comes form the quite showy berries that will persist throughout the winter and often into early spring.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Occasional disease problems include leaf spots and powdery mildew.  Plants do poorly in neutral to alkaline soils where they are susceptible to chlorosis (yellowing of leaves) and often die.
","
Garden Uses
Year round interest, highlighted by the showy display of red berries in winter.  Mass or group in shrub borders, foundations, native plant areas or bird gardens.  Hedge.  Excellent shrub for moist soils in low spots or along streams and ponds.  Although an attractive shrub, the species is infrequently sold in commerce because of the many excellent cultivars which generally produce showier flowers and larger, more abundant fruit.

Culture
Grow in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. In its native habitat, it grows in dry to wet conditions, in a variety of soils and in sun or shade. It generally tolerates more drought than most other hollies. Although it is a popular landscape plant in the southeastern U.S., it is not winter hardy to the St. Louis area where, if attempted, it should be grown in a protected location with a winter mulch. Prune in winter if needed. Plants of this species are dioecious (separate male and female plants). Female plants need a male pollinator in the area in order to bear fruit. Promptly remove root suckers unless naturalization is desired.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ilex vomitoria, commonly known as Yaupon, is native to a variety of areas including sandy woods, dunes, open fields, forest edges and wet swamps, often along the coastal plain and maritime forests, from Virginia to Florida, Arkansas and Texas. This is a thicket-forming, broadleaf evergreen shrub or small tree that typically grows in an upright, irregularly branched form to 10-20’ tall and to 10’ wide, but may grow taller in optimum conditions. Elliptic to ovate-oblong, leathery, glossy, evergreen, dark green leaves (to 1.5” long) have toothed margins. Small greenish-white flowers appear on male and female plants in spring (April). Flowers are fragrant but generally inconspicuous. Pollinated flowers on female plants give way to berry-like red (infrequently yellow) fruits (1/4” diameter) which ripen in fall and persist into winter. Birds are attracted to the fruit. 

Native American Indians used the leaves to make a ceremonial emetic drink which, when consumed in large quantities, caused a cleansing now memorialized by the specific epithet.Genus name comes from the Latin name Quercus ilex for holm oak in reference to the foliage similarities (holm oak and many of the shrubs in the genus Ilex have evergreen leaves).Specific epithet refers to the emetic quality of the leaves.
","
Problems
Winter hardiness in St. Louis is a significant concern. In their native habitat, plants have good resistance to insects and diseases. Potential insect problems include holly leaf miner, spider mites, whitefly and scale. Potential disease problems include leaf spot, leaf rot, tar spot and powdery mildew.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Impatiens balsamina, commonly called rose balsam or garden balsam, is an erect, sparsely-branched, tender annual that typically grows to 6-30” tall (depending on variety). Although an old garden favorite since at least Victorian times, it has been eclipsed in popularity in recent years by its close relative, the flat-flowered garden impatiens (Impatiens walleriana). Cup-shaped single to mostly double flowers (to 2” diameter) with incurved spurs come in various shades of pink, rose, red, purple, white and bicolor versions thereof. Flowers are often spotted. The double camellia-like cultivars are currently the most popular plants in the species. Flowers bloom singly or in small clusters (2-3) from the leaf axils throughout the growing season. Elliptic to lance-shaped, deeply serrate leaves (to 3.5” long) are light green.Genus name comes from the Latin word impatiens meaning impatient in reference to the violent seed discharge from the ripe pods.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Impatiens capensis, commonly called spotted touch-me-not or jewelweed, is a Missouri native annual plant of boggy, shady areas. It typically occurs in low woodlands and thickets, along stream banks and in swampy areas throughout the State. It grows 2-5' tall on weak, watery stems. Features 1"" long, rear-spurred, cornucopia-shaped, orange to orange-yellow flowers with reddish-brown spotting. Flowers bloom throughout the summer. Each flower dangles from a leaf axil on its own slender stalk. Flowers give way to slender seed capsules which when ripe explosively split open at a touch dispersing the tiny seeds within in all directions, hence the common name of touch-me-not. Oval, coarsely-toothed, bluish-green leaves (to 3.5"" long). Native Americans used the watery plant juices to relieve itching associated with poison ivy, stinging nettle and insect bites.Genus name comes from the Latin word impatiens meaning impatient in reference to the violent seed discharge from the ripe pods.Specific epithet means of the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, but this is a misnomer here as this plant is native to North America.Dew or rain beads up on the leaves forming sparkling droplets which give rise to the common name of jewelweed.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11. In St. Louis, grow as bedding annuals, container plants or houseplants. Easily grown in evenly moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Although some varieties may be grown from seed started indoors 8-10 weeks before last frost date, numerous selections are available for purchase each year in inexpensive cell/six packs from a myriad of retail outlets ranging from nurseries to corner grocery stores. Unless a hard-to-find variety is desired, most gardeners simply purchase cell packs in spring, enjoy the long flowering season, allow the plants to succumb to frost in fall and then purchase new plants the following spring. Set out plants after last frost date. Pinch back stems of young plants to encourage branching and/or compact growth. Consider taking cuttings from unique and/or favorite plants in late summer or potting up the occasional unique plant itself in fall for overwintering. Overwintered plants need bright light but not direct sun, with reduced watering for the winter rest period.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Impatiens walleriana, commonly called impatiens or bizzy Lizzy, is the most popular annual bedding plant in the U.S. today. For easy-to-grow, non-stop flowering in shady conditions, it has no equal. It is a bushy, succulent-stemmed tender perennial that grows in a spreading mound to 6-24” tall depending on variety. It has been extensively hybridized to produce a large number of cultivars featuring flowers in various shades of pink, rose, red, lilac, purple, orange, white and bicolor versions thereof. Showy, slender-spurred, five-petaled (some doubles are available) flowers (1- 2 1/4” wide) typically cover the plants with colorful bloom from spring to frost. Single flowers have a distinctively flattened appearance. Ovate to elliptic leaves (to 3” long) are light green to dark green, sometimes with a bronze-red cast.Genus name comes from the Latin word impatiens meaning impatient in reference to the violent seed discharge from the ripe pods.

Culture
Easily grown in dry to moist, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  In warm winter areas, it naturalizes aggressively by both rhizomes and self-seeding to form dense monocultures which displace native species.  It is tolerant of shade, poor soils, and drought.  It tends to be less aggressive in the cooler conditions of USDA Zones 5-6.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Imperata cylindrica, commonly known as cogongrass, is now considered to be one of the ten worst weeds in the world.  It is native to Korea, Japan, China, India, and tropical eastern Africa.  It was introduced into the southeastern U.S. in the early 1900s, unintentionally in the form of packing materials contained in shipping cartons imported into the U.S. and intentionally as a forage grass and/or erosion control plant.  This grass is now listed as a Federal Noxious Weed under the Plant Protection Act which means it may not be imported or transported between States without first obtaining a federal permit.  It has also been declared a noxious weed by a number of States including Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Hawaii.    

This is an opportunistic, rapid-growing perennial grass that spreads invasively in warm winter locations, particularly evident in the southeastern U.S. from South Carolina and Florida to Texas.  It is typically found in a number of different sites including roadsides, pastures, mined areas, fields, sand dunes, utility right-of-ways and dry scrubs.  It grows in spreading clumps to 2-4’ tall.  Yellowish green leaves (to 30” long and to 3/4” wide) feature finely serrated edges, off-center light green to white midribs, and sharp tips.  Flowers in cylindrical spikes to 16” long bloom in early spring (March-May), albeit infrequently,  in the northern parts of its growing range, but can flower year round in semi-tropical to tropical areas. 

Some authorities currently list this grass as being present in five or more varieties, including var. major (the highly invasive variety described herein which is found in the wild in east/southeast Asia and the southeastern U.S.) and var. rubra (non-invasive ornamental red leaved cultivars still sold by nurseries in some states under the common name of Japanese bloodgrass).Genus name honors Ferrante Imperato (1550-1625) an apothecary (pharmacist) of Naples.Specific epithet means long and round, cylindrical.
","
Problems
No known serious insect or disease problems.  Green-leaved species plants are highly invasive.
","
Garden Uses
Under Federal law, it is illegal to transport cogongrass into or within the United States without first obtaining a permit.  Several states have laws forbidding its sale or growth.

Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun.  Tolerates some light afternoon shade, particularly in hot and humid summer climates.  Tolerates neutral to slightly alkaline soils.  Established plants tolerate some drought.  Plants may suffer tip damage or die to the ground in harsh winters of USDA Zone 5, but usually will come back nicely in spring.  Flowers bloom on new growth.  Several pruning options exist.  As is often done with Buddleja, plant stems may be cut back close to the ground in late winter to early spring each year before new growth appears.  Another option is to simply prune stems back to live wood in early spring of each year.

Indigofera amblyantha, commonly called indigofera or indigo, is a deciduous, spreading shrub that is native to forest margins and streambanks in central to south central China.  It typically grows in a rounded form to 4-6' tall and as wide.  It is perhaps best noted for producing a very long bloom (May to September) of attractive pale lilac to rose to pink pea-shaped flowers in narrow vertical racemes (2-5"" long) growing from the leaf axils.  Flowers are followed by dark purple seed pods.   Each compound odd-pinnate leaf (4-6"" long) has 7-13 ovate gray-green leaflets (each to 1 1/4"" long).   No appreciable fall color.Genus name comes from indigo plus Latin fero meaning to bear. The dye indigo is obtained from this genus.

Culture
Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun. Tolerates alkaline soils and some drought. Plants are intolerant of the hot and humid summers of the deep South where some part afternoon shade may help prevent leaves from bleaching. Plants may suffer some tip damage or die to the ground in harsh winters of USDA zone 5, but should come back nicely in spring. Flowers bloom on new growth. Several pruning options exist. As is often done with Buddleja, plant stems may be cut back close to the ground in late winter to early spring each year before new growth appears. Another option is to simply prune stems back to live wood in early spring of each year. Plants will sucker to form large colonies in optimum growing conditions. Promptly remove suckers to prevent unwanted spread.

Established plants tolerate some drought.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Indigofera tinctoria, commonly called true indigo, is a deciduous spreading tropical shrub or subshrub of the pea family that typically grows to 2-3’ tall and as wide.  As suggested by the common name, this shrub was the original source of the blue dye known as indigo.  It is probably native to China, tropical Asia and parts of Africa, but the specific location is not entirely clear because this shrub has been in cultivation since at least 4000 BC with introduction and naturalization taking place in many places around the world before good records were kept.  It became a cash crop in the Southeastern U.S. in the 1700s where it has now naturalized in some areas.  Leaves of this plant contain indican.  Dye is obtained by fermentation of the leaves which converts the indican into the blue dye indigotin.  

True indigo features light green pinnate leaves (each with 4 to 7 pairs of leaflets) and short racemes of summer-blooming pink or violet flowers.  Flowers are followed by seed pods (to 2” long).     

True indigo is much less in demand today for commercial dye purposes because of the creation of synthetic dyes which have now taken its place for most purposes.  Plants are still commercially grown, mostly on small farms, for those desiring natural dye, premium clothing companies, amateur gardeners, and traditional medicine.Genus name comes from indigo plus Latin fero meaning to bear. The dye indigo is obtained from this genus.Specific epithet from Latin means used in dyeing.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Inula britannica, commonly called British elecampane, British yellowhead or meadow fleabane, is an erect, rhizomatous, sunflower-like, herbaceous biennial or perennial in the composite family.  Once established in the landscape, this plant will spread aggressively and rapidly by seeds, rhizomes or root fragments.  Although this plant has been, albeit unintentionally, introduced into North America in the past, it is only known to have escaped cultivation and naturalized in a very limited number of areas in Ontario, Quebec, New York State and Washington D.C.  Notwithstanding its very limited physical presence in the U.S., its aggressive and invasive tendencies are well-known. Some U.S. nurseries have encountered situations where rhizomes of this plant have been intertwined and well hidden within the root systems of hostas imported from a few European nurseries, thus suggesting a possible unintentional release and subsequent naturalization of plants via transactions taking place in the normal course of commerce.    

In 2010, Inula britannica was added to the Federal Noxious Weed List which prohibits the importation or movement of any listed noxious weed into or through the United States.  

This plant is native to Europe and Asia where it typically thrives in a variety of moist habitats including marshes, meadows, ditches, stream banks, wet grassland, wet woods, roadsides and wastelands.  Bright yellow sunflowers (to 1” across) subtended by linear floral bracts bloom alone or in clusters of 2 or 3 from June to September on stems rising to 15-30” tall.  Each flower features yellow rays surrounding a center disk of darker yellow tubular flowers.  Leaves are sparsely hairy above but densely hairy beneath.  Short-stalked basal leaves (to 6” long) are elliptical to ovate-elliptical.  Stalkless shorter cauline leaves are lanceolate-elliptic to lanceolate-linear.  Leaf margins are smooth to finely-toothed.  Stems range from almost hairless to being densely covered with appressed hairs.  Seeds are light brown with feather-like hairs which facilitate easy dispersal by wind.Genus name is the Latin name for this plant.Specific epithet is in reference to the presence of this plant in Great Britain.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Inula helenium, commonly called elecampane, is a rhizomatous, sunflower-like composite of the aster family that is native to Europe and northern Asia, but has naturalized in fields, clearings, disturbed sites, roadsides and waste places in parts of eastern North America from Nova Scotia to Minnesota south to North Carolina and Missouri. It typically grows to 3-6' tall.  It is noted for having coarse, toothed, rough-hairy leaves (thin hairy above and velvet-hairy beneath).  Ovate-elliptic basal leaves typically grow to 1-2' long on petioles extending to as much as 1' long.  Ovate-lanceolate stem leaves are much shorter and sessile, decreasing in size from the bottom to the top of the central rigid hairy stalk.  Sunflower-like flowers (2-3"" diameter), each subtended by broad floral bracts, feature numerous very thin, scraggly yellow rays which surround a center disk of darker yellow tubular flowers.  Flowers bloom July-September.  This plant has a long and interesting history as a medicinal herb wherein the rhizomes and roots were at one point used in a large variety of medical applications, primarily in the treatment of a large number of respiratory-type ailments.  The root is used today in France and Switzerland as a flavoring for absinthe.Genus name is the Latin name for this plant.Specific epithet is in reference to Helen of Troy (one story claims this plant grew where Helen's tears fell when she was abducted by Paris).Common name comes from Old English elene which comes from Latin enula meaning genus name and campanus meaning of the field.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Iodanthus pinnatifidus, commonly called purple rocket, is a perennial of the mustard family that is native from Connecticut to Minnesota south to Alabama and Texas. It is typically found growing in low, moist woodlands, on stream flood plains plus adjacent slopes and in moist meadows. In Missouri, it is found throughout the State except for much of the Ozark region, southeastern lowlands region and northeastern corner (Steyermark). Plants typically grow 1-2’ (less frequently 3’) tall on single stems that are unbranched below the flower clusters. Lower leaves are often pinnately lobed near the base, featuring 1-4 pairs of toothed lobes and a large ovate end segment. Upper leaves are simple, elliptic to oblong-ovate with clasping bases. Mildly fragrant flowers (1/3” wide) have four light violet petals and bloom in branched terminal and axillary clusters in May-June. Flowers fade to white as they age. Flowers give way to elongated seed pods.Genus name comes from the Greek words for violet (iodes) and flower (anthus).Specific epithet is in reference to the often pinnately lobed lower leaves.

Culture
Moonflower is a tender perennial vine that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12. In St.Louis, it is grown as an annual in moist, well-drained soils in full sun. This vine needs a support structure upon which to grow. It is easily grown from seed. Start seed indoors about 6-8 weeks before last spring frost date. Notch seed coat with a knife before planting to promote better germination. Seed could be started outdoors after last frost date, but the onset of bloom would occur unacceptably late in summer. Take new young plants outdoors about 1-2 weeks after last spring frost date. Once established, growth is rapid. Seeds may be harvested in fall, but only mature seeds that have fully ripened on the vine are of value. Plants grown in containers could be brought inside in fall for overwintering, albeit with some difficulty, but most gardeners simply start new seed indoors each spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ipomoea alba, commonly called moonflower, is native to tropical America. It is a tender perennial vine that is grown in St. Louis as a warm weather annual. It is noted for its fragrant nocturnal white blooms (moonflowers) and its deep green foliage. Although it will grow to 70’ or more in tropical climates, it typically reaches 10-15’ in a single season as an annual. Milky-juiced, somewhat prickly, twining stems are clad with large, rounded, broad-ovate, deep green leaves (4-8” long) with cordate bases. Fragrant, white flowers (to 6” diameter) bloom at dusk from mid-summer into fall. Flowers unfold in early evening before nightfall from attractive spiraled tubular flower buds. Flowers remain open all night and eventually close before noon the following day. Flowers attract night-flying moths. This plant is synonymous with and formerly known as Ipomoea bona-nox and Calonyction aculeatum.Genus name comes from the Greek words ips meaning worm and homoios meaning resembling, in probable reference to the sprawling underground roots of genus plants.  On the other hand, some experts suggest the genus name is in reference to the worm-like twining plant habit.Specific epithet means white.

Culture
Water spinach is an easy to grow herbaceous aquatic or semi-aquatic annual that can be propagated through seeds, or cuttings if they are available. Stem cuttings can be rooted in water or moist sand and transplanted into pots of fertile potting soil mixture and placed in a sunny location. These plants relish heat, humidity, water, and nutrients. Water spinach does not grow well below 70° F. Some varieties will also thrive in water. Once established, cutting may be made at any time. Like the related sweet potato, the stems have a white latex, and only the youngest, fastest growing tips are harvested for cooking. The less suitable the growing conditions, the tougher and latexy the greens will be.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ipomoea aquatica, commonly called water spinach, belongs to the morning-glory family. Likely of Chinese origin, cultivation dates back more than 2,000 years. Widely grown today in China, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, it is sold in Asian markets in tightly packed bunches. Both the arrow shaped light green leaves and the stems are used stir fried or steamed. Chopped and cooked, they are used as filling for steamed buns and dim sum or deep fried as a component of spring rolls.

Flowers are morning-glory like, 2 inches wide, funnel shaped, and white, pink or pale lilac depending on the variety. Also like morning-glories, water spinach is a vine. Under optimal condition, a single water spinach plant can branch profusely with stems growing to over 70 feet long. Each growing tip can advance 4 inches per day. In Florida, water spinach has created impenetrable masses of tangled vegetation and obstructed water flow in drainage and flood control canals. Along lake, pond, and river shoreline it has displaced native plants important for fish and wildlife. Over smaller ponds and retention basins, it has formed dense, impenetrable canopies creating stagnant water conditions ideal for mosquitoes. For these reasons, Florida has listed it as a prohibited plant and noxious weed, the possession of which is prohibited without a special permit. Federally, water spinach is listed as a “noxious weed” under the Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974 (7 U.S.C. 2802 (c)) and as such may be moved into or through the United States only under permit from the USDA Plant Protection and Quarantine Program, and under conditions that would not involve a danger of dissemination.Genus name comes from the Greek words ips meaning worm and homoios meaning resembling, in probable reference to the sprawling underground roots of genus plants.  On the other hand, some experts suggest the genus name is in reference to the worm-like twining plant habit.Specific epithet means growing in or near water.
","
Problems
Few pests are a problem for this plant.
","
Garden Uses
Water spinach is prepared like conventional spinach, although the texture of the stems and leaves is improved if they are cooked separately. It may be steamed, boiled, stir-fried, or used in soups. It may also be eaten in salads, either raw or blanched briefly.

Culture
Tender perennial that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 9-11. In St. Louis, grow as an annual or dig tubers in fall. Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Best leaf color usually occurs in full sun. Consistently moist soils are best. This is a tuberous plant that is not grown from seed. Purchase plants in spring and set out after last frost date. In fall before first frost, dig, dry and store tubers in a dry medium (vermiculite or peat) in a cool dry corner of the basement. When tubers sprout in spring, cut them into sections (at least one eye per section) and plant the sections outdoors after last frost date. Tubers can also be sunk ½ way into a large-mouthed glass jar of water in early spring to generate sprouts that can be removed and planted. Container plants and or rooted cuttings taken in late summer may be overwintered indoors in bright sunny locations. Best to rotate plantings to different locations of the garden from year to year to minimize possible fungal disease problems.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ipomoea batatas, commonly called sweet potato or sweet potato vine, is native to tropical America. It is a tuberous rooted tender perennial that has been cultivated for its orange-fleshed edible tubers for over 2000 years. It was reportedly brought back to Europe from the New World by Columbus. Today, the sweet potato is a popular root vegetable that is grown in vegetable gardens and as a commercial food crop throughout the world. Although species plants and varieties grown as food crops have somewhat attractive green foliage, it is the more recently introduced purple-, chartreuse- and variegated-leaved cultivars that have transformed this vegetable into a popular ornamental foliage plant. If grown as a ground cover, plant stems typically mound to 9” tall but spread by trailing stems to 8-10’ wide, rooting in the ground at the nodes as they go. Leaves of the ornamental varieties are heart-shaped to palmately-lobed (to 6” long) and come in bright green, dark purple, chartreuse and variegated (green with pink or white) colors. Although species plants produce pale pink to violet trumpet-shaped flowers, ornamental varieties usually do not flower. Tubers of the ornamental varieties are edible, but are not as tasty as those of the varieties specifically bred for food production.Genus name comes from the Greek words ips meaning worm and homoios meaning resembling, in probable reference to the sprawling underground roots of genus plants.  On the other hand, some experts suggest the genus name is in reference to the worm-like twining plant habit.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Fungal leaf diseases are somewhat common, particularly if plants are grown in the same garden area year after year. Watch for thrips and flea beetles.
","
Garden Uses
Species cultivars are ornamental subtropical vines that are most often used as sprawling ground covers or as foliage contrasts grown to hang down over the edge of containers or window boxes.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Ipomoea mauritiana, commonly known as morning glory, is a vigorous, twining, tuberous-rooted, tender perennial vine that may be grown in St. Louis as a warm weather annual.  It is native to montane forests, thickets, streambanks, seashores and waste places in southern China, Japan, Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka, New Guinea, the Philippines, and Pacific Islands, but is now distributed throughout the Pantropics.  It is noted for its funnel-shaped pink to reddish purple flowers (to 2"" across) with darker throats which bloom in axillary or terminal cymes on stems clad with circular leaves (to 6-8”) that are palmately divided into 5-7 acuminate, elliptic to lance-shaped segments.  Vines can grow to 30' long or more in tropical areas, but will typically reach 10-15’ in one year when grown as an annual.Genus name comes from the Greek words ips meaning worm and homoios meaning resembling, in probable reference to the sprawling underground roots of genus plants.  On the other hand, some experts suggest the genus name is in reference to the worm-like twining plant habit.Specific epithet is in reference to the island nation of Mauritus located in the Indian ocean.

Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade.  Prefers moist soils.  Established plants have some drought tolerance, however.  Plants can become somewhat weedy and difficult to eradicate from areas of the landscape due to its extensive root system.  Deadhead spent flowers to help prevent naturalization by wind-blown seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ipomoea pandurata, commonly called wild potato vine, man-of-the-earth, man root and Indian potato, is a vigorous, twining or trailing perennial vine of the morning glory family that grows to 15-30’ long on smooth to slightly pubescent, sometimes purplish stems rising from a vertical, starchy root system that matures over time to as much as 4’ long with a weigh of 25-30 pounds.  This vine is native to moist to somewhat dry habitats including fallow and cultivated fields, roadsides, dry slopes, railroad right-of-ways, and along streams in Eastern North America from Connecticut to Ontario to Michigan and Iowa south to Texas and Florida.  It typically sprawls along the ground in open areas or climbs vegetation.  It is found throughout most of the State of Missouri.  

This vine is noted for its large, funnel-shaped, white flowers (2-3” across) with reddish purple eyes.  Flowers bloom from the leaf axils in cymose inflorescences composed of up to 7 perfect actinomorphic (radially symmetrical) flowers from late May to September.  The funnelform corolla of each flower has five shallow lobes.  Simple, polymorphic (variable), olive green leaves are thin, entire, alternate, petiolate, cordate to ovate or occasionally pandurate (fiddle-shaped), with each leaf extending to 3-6” long with a pointed tip.  Fruit is a glabrous, ovoid, 2-celled dehiscent capsule (to 3/5” long) which opens at maturity to disburse its hairy seeds to the wind.  

Roots can be cooked and were an important food source for native Americans but fresh uncooked roots have purgative properties.  Native Americans also used the roots for preparation of poultices, infusions and teas for treatment of a variety of medical problems including rheumatism, cholera, kidney disease, coughs, abdominal pains and constipation.Genus name comes from the Greek words ips meaning worm and homoios meaning resembling, in probable reference to the sprawling underground roots of genus plants.  On the other hand, some experts suggest the genus name is in reference to the worm-like twining plant habit.Specific epithet means fiddle-like in reference to leaf shape.

It is easily grown from seed that may be started indoors about 6-8 weeks before last spring frost date. Notch seed coat with a knife before planting to promote better germination. Seed could be started outdoors after last frost date, but the onset of bloom would occur much later. Take new young plants outdoors about 1-2 weeks after last spring frost date. Once established, growth is rapid. Mature seeds may be harvested in fall. Plants grown in containers could be brought inside in fall for overwintering, albeit with some difficulty, but most gardeners simply start new seed indoors each spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Native to Mexico and Central America, common morning glory is a warm weather annual twining vine that is ornamentally grown for its attractive purple flowers and broad cordate-ovate leaves. It will grow 6-10’ long in a single season. Trumpet-shaped purple flowers (to 2.5” wide) with white throats bloom late spring to fall. Flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon, hence the common name. Flower colors of cultivars include white, pink, red and magenta. Species plants have escaped gardens and naturalized throughout much of the U.S. Synonymous with and formerly known as Convolvulus purpureus.Genus name comes from the Greek words ips meaning worm and homoios meaning resembling, in probable reference to the sprawling underground roots of genus plants.  On the other hand, some experts suggest the genus name is in reference to the worm-like twining plant habit.specific epithet means tending towards purple.

Culture
This tropical vine is an annual. It is easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. It will tolerate some dry conditions, but grows best with consistently moist soils. This vine is thin-stemmed and somewhat fragile, and it needs a support structure upon which to grow. It is easily grown from seed. Start seed indoors about 6-8 weeks before last spring frost date or plant directly in the ground at last frost date. In many areas of the U.S. (particularly in USDA Zones 6-10), it will remain in the garden, spread to other areas and naturalize from year to year by self-seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Ipomoea quamoclit, commonly called cypress vine, is native to tropical America. It is a warm weather annual twining vine of the morning glory family that is ornamentally grown for its attractive scarlet flowers and fern-like foliage. It typically will grow 6-10’ long, but infrequently to as much as 20’ long. Each green leaf (2-4” long) is pinnately divided into threadlike segments, giving the foliage a ferny appearance. Scarlet red flowers (to 3/4” across) bloom in small cymes from early summer into fall. Each tubular flower is star-shaped, flaring open at the mouth into five pointed lobes. Flowers are attractive to hummingbirds and butterflies. Cypress vine has naturalized in many areas of the U.S., particularly in the deep South, ranging from Florida to Texas north to Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and New York. It is not considered too aggressive, however, and does not seem to crowd out native plants. It is also commonly called cardinal climber, star glory and indian pink. Synonymous with and formerly know as Quamoclit pennata.Genus name comes from the Greek words ips meaning worm and homoios meaning resembling, in probable reference to the sprawling underground roots of genus plants.  On the other hand, some experts suggest the genus name is in reference to the worm-like twining plant habit.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-12 where it is usually grown in moist well-drained soils in full sun. In St. Louis, it is grown as a houseplant or garden annual. As a houseplant, it needs a soil-based potting mix and bright indoor light with morning sun, but some protection from direct afternoon summer sun. Keep soils consistently moist in the growing season, but reduce moisture from fall to late winter. Pinch tips to maintain shape and to promote bushier foliage. Also, consider pinching out any flower buds that may appear to concentrate plant energies on the foliage. Indoor plants may be taken outdoors in summer. When grown outdoors as an annual, plants or late-summer stem cuttings therefrom may be overwintered indoors. If plants become leggy, cuttings may be easily rooted in water to produce new plants each year.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Iresine herbstii, commonly called bloodleaf or beefsteak plant. is native to Brazil. It is noted for its ornamental foliage. This is a short-lived perennial that is often grown as an annual. In its native habitat, it may grow to 5’ tall with spread to 3’ wide. Potted indoor plants grow much smaller, typically being pruned to 12-18” tall. Red stems and oval purple-red leaves (to 4” long) with notched tips and light red veins. Requires sun exposure for best foliage color. Inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. Rarely blooms in cultivation.Genus name comes from the Greek word eiresione meaning a branch or wreath wrapped with wool in probable reference to the woolly flowers.‘Brilliantissima’ features purplish-red leaves with pink veins. ‘Aureoreticulata’ features green leaves with yellow veins.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Iresine rhizomatosa, commonly called woodland amaranth or Juda’s bush, is a dioecious rhizomatous perennial herb of the Amaranth family that typically grows to 2-4’ tall.  It is native to low woods, floodplain forests, wet woodlands, bluff bases, thickets near streams and along stream banks from Maryland to Kansas south to Texas and Virginia.  It features erect usually unbranched stems clad with thin, simple, opposite, ovate to ovate-lanceolate leaves (to 6” long and to 3” wide) with pointed tips.  Leaves are deep green above and light green beneath.  Minute, creamy white to silver-white flowers (1/4” long) bloom August to October in many-flowered, spike-like, axillary and terminal inflorescences (panicles to 12” long).  Plants are dioecious (male and female flowers are on separate plants), with the pistillate inflorescences being narrow pyramidal and the staminate inflorescences being thin panicles.  Sepals of the pistillate flowers are subtended by long white hairs (to 1/4” long).  Pistillate flowers give way to round indehiscent utricles, each containing one brownish-red seed.Genus name comes from the Greek word eiresione meaning a branch or wreath wrapped with wool in probable reference to the woolly flowers.Specific epithet is in reference to plant rhizomes.Plants in the genus Iresine often carry the common name of bloodleaf which is very descriptive of the blood red leaves of some genus plants native to the tropics and often grown as ornamentals (e.g., I. herbstii and I. lindenii), but is not very descriptive of the green leaves of the within plant which is winter hardy to USDA Zones 5 to 8 in the U.S.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Loves acidic, organically rich, saturated, moisture-retentive soils. During the growing season, it thrives in standing water (up to 6” deep). However in winter, it is intolerant of both standing water and boggy soils where rhizomes may rot. In order to meet these somewhat unusual seasonal cultural requirements, plants may be grown in pots that are sunk half way in water during the growing season but then removed to dryer ground for fall and winter. Japanese iris grows surprisingly well in garden soils, albeit less vigorously, as long as it receives consistent moisture. Plant rhizomes approximately 2” deep in fall or spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Iris ensata, commonly called Japanese iris or Japanese water iris, is a rhizomatous beardless perennial iris that grows in slowly expanding clumps to 2-4’ tall. Sword-shaped, linear green leaves (to 24” long) have prominent midribs. Flowers (typically 3-6” across) have a distinctively flattened appearance. Cultivars come in single, double and peony flowered forms in a wide range of colors including shades of blue, lavender, violet-red, pink and white. Blooms early to mid summer (later than both bearded and Siberian iris). Synonymous with I. kaempferi.Genus named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow.Specific epithet means sword-shaped.

Culture
Best grown in moist, humusy, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Established plants tolerate some dry conditions. This species is more shade-tolerant than most other species of Iris. Plants are not reliably winter hardy in the St. Louis area where they benefit from a protected location and winter mulch. Although leaves are evergreen in warm winter climates, they usually do not survive St. Louis winters. Plants are slow to establish, and may not produce quality seed displays until the second or third year. Divide in spring or fall as needed (spring is perhaps best in St. Louis). Can be somewhat surprisingly easy to grow from seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Iris foetidissima, commonly called stinking iris, Gladwin iris and coral iris, is perhaps grown more for its attractive coral seed clusters than for its flowers. This is a rhizomatous, beardless iris which typically grows 1.5 to 2' tall. Pale lilac flowers bloom in late spring on scapes rising 10-24"" tall. Flowers are followed by seed capsules which mature over the summer and split open in early fall to reveal stringy clusters of bead-like, bright orange-red seeds which are extremely showy and persistent, often remaining in the open pods on the plants well into winter. Seed stalks are valued for dried flower arrangements. Dark green sword-shaped linear leaves (to 24"" long and 1"" wide) are unpleasantly aromatic (though not necessarily fetid as the species name suggests) when cut or bruised.Genus named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow.Specific epithet means very bad-smelling.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Iris fulva is commonly called copper iris because of the unusual copper color of its flowers. It is a beardless, crestless iris (Louisiana Iris group) that is native to swamps and wetlands of the deep South and of the lower Mississippi Valley from Louisiana north to southeastern Missouri and southern Illinois. In Missouri, it is primarily found in bald cypress swamps, sloughs, ponds, ditches and swampy woodland areas in the southeastern corner of the State (Steyermark). It is often found growing and blooming in standing water in spring-flooded areas that typically dry up as the summer progresses. Terra cotta or copper colored irises appear in late spring atop flower scapes typically growing 2-3’ tall. Flowers are reportedly pollinated by hummingbirds. Sword-shaped, linear, bright green leaves. In New Orleans in March of 1821, John James Audubon painted a pair of parula warblers perching on the stem of a copper iris in a painting that became an entry in The Birds of North America.Genus named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow.Specific epithet means tawny for the flower color.

Heavy clay soils such as those present in much of the St. Louis area must be amended prior to planting (e.g., add gypsum, coarse sand, organic matter) or raised plantings should be considered.  Plant rhizomes shallowly (cover with 1/2” soil) and 12-24” apart in mid to late summer (July to early September).  Fertilize lightly in early spring.  Avoid overhead watering.  Deadhead individual spent flowers and remove flowering stems to the ground after bloom.  Divide plants immediately after flowering when overcrowding occurs (every 3-4 years).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Iris germanica, commonly called common flag or German iris, is the presumed father of most modern bearded iris cultivars.  Origin is uncertain, but species plants are probably native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean area.  This iris has become established over time throughout the world, with naturalization having occurred in many parts of Europe and the U.S. It is difficult to specifically describe German iris as a species because it appears in so many different forms. Thousands of bearded iris cultivars have been introduced into commerce over time.  Iris germanica as a species is simply not sold in commerce today.  In general terms, plants grow 2-3' tall with sword-shaped linear leaves and large usually fragrant blooms on stalks that branch below their mid points.  Each flower has six perianth segments:  three falls are purple with brown veins, white bases and  yellow beards and three standards are lilac.  Each stalk (to 3' tall) typically produces up to 6 flowers in spring.  Sword shaped leaves are mostly basal, in two ranks, and about 2' long.  German iris has no bulb.  It spreads by creeping rhizomes which form large clumps over time.  Thousands of bearded iris cultivars in a rainbow of different colors have been introduced over the years, with cultivars now classified into several different types:  miniature dwarf (8"" or less), standard dwarf (8-15 inches), intermediate (16-27 inches), miniature tall (16-25 inches but with small flowers), border (16-27 inches) and tall (28-38 inches).Genus named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow.Specific epithet means of Germany.
","
Problems
The major insect pest of German iris is iris borer.  Major disease problems are bacterial soft rot, crown rot fungus,  and fungal leaf spot.  Watch for mottling of leaves and flowers which may indicate the presence of mosaic virus.  Good sanitation practices are the most important component of any disease/insect control program:  promptly remove and destroy diseased foliage/rhizomes, promptly remove and destroy borer-infected foliage/rhizomes and perform an annual clean-up of all debris and foliage from beds in fall after frost.  The most frequent causes of failure to flower or sparse flowering are (1) rhizomes are planted too deep, (2) plants are located in too much shade, (3) plants were given too much fertilizer or (4) plants have become overcrowded and need division.
","
Garden Uses
Sunny beds and borders.  Will naturalize into large clumps.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Iris hexagona, commonly called Dixie iris or Carolina iris, is a rhizomatous perennial native to coastal plains, swamps, marshes, bayous, damp hillsides, ditches, riversides, slow-moving streams and areas of shallow water in the southeastern U.S. ranging from South Carolina to Florida and Louisiana.  It typically grows to 3-4’ tall with a spread to 9-18” wide.  Mildly fragrant, blue to violet (rarely white) iris flowers (to 3 1/2” deep) bloom in spring (April-May) on stems rising from a clump of stiffly erect, yellow-green to bright-green, sword-shaped, basal leaves (each to 2-3’ long and to 1 1/4” wide).  Each flower features a funnelform perianth consisting of three wide-spreading, downward-arching falls (sepals) and three upright but shorter and narrower standards (petals).  Signals are bright yellow.  Leaves wither and die after flowering, but new leaves emerge in fall for the following year.  This is one of five species of iris that make up the Louisiana Iris group (Series Hexagonae).  It is currently considered to be one of the rarest of the irises native to the U.S.Genus named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow.Specific epithet means six-angled in reference to the six-angled seed pods.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Leaf spot, bacterial soft rot, iris rust and mosaic viruses may appear.  Watch for slugs, snails, cutworms, whiteflies, leaf miners, aphids and thrips.  Iris borers can cause significant problems in areas where they are found.
","
Garden Uses
Water gardens, bog gardens, moist low spots.  Pond, pool, stream or river margins.  Thrives in several inches of shallow water.  If grown in borders, it needs a moist to wet mulch to help retain soil moisture.

Culture
In mild summer climates, best performance typically occurs in medium to wet, well-drained soils in full sun.  In hot summer climates, this iris appreciates some afternoon shade.  Although considered a wetland plant, it can tolerate some dry soils once established but only after bloom.  It needs consistent moisture from spring to 6 weeks after flowering ends in order for plants to bloom well.  With clay soils or in areas of high rainfall, plant this iris on slopes (growing end uphill) or in raised beds to promote good drainage and discourage the onset of rhizome rot.  Plant rhizomes, depending on location, 12-20” apart from late July through October (late July–early September in areas with cold winters or September-October in areas with mild winters).   Plant each rhizome shallowly over a baseball-sized mound of soil with 1/3 of the rhizome above the soil and with the roots horizontally spread to support the plant.  Growth comes from the leafy end of the rhizome.  If overcrowding occurs over time, lift the clump in late summer (August) with a garden fork, divide and replant.  Keep the iris bed free of weeds.  This rhizomatous iris propagates readily from plant division in fall or winter.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Iris missouriensis, commonly known as western blue flag and Rocky Mountain iris, is a beardless iris that grows from an irregularly-creeping tuberous rhizome.  In the wild, it typically rises to 12-24” tall. It is native to wet meadow and marshy mountainous areas in western North America from North Dakota to British Columbia south to California and New Mexico.  It is commonly found in habitats ranging from low valleys to alpine areas up to 9000’ in elevation.  

Each plant typically bears 1-4 variegated, violet blue iris flowers (each 2-3” long) per stem.  Each flower has 6 perianth segments:  (a) three elongated spreading to reflexed falls have a central dark yellow-orange stripe and diverging blue lines on a white background and (b) three erect standards are narrower and lilac-purple to dark blue.  Flowers bloom at the top of stout leafless stalks that rise up among dense, flexible, tough, sword-shaped leaves.  Leaves typically rise above the flower stems.Genus named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow.Specific epithet is in reference to the Missouri River and not to the State of Missouri where this plant is not native.  Lewis and Clark first collected this plant along the Missouri River in 1806.

Easily grown in average, medium to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Best performance is in acidic, saturated, moisture-retentive soils. Plants thrive in standing water (to 12” deep) where they prefer full sun. Plants grown in garden soils prefer some afternoon shade. Plants will naturalize easily by spreading rhizomes and self-seeding to form large colonies, sometimes to the point of being considered weedy and aggressive. Plants may be grown in containers that are sunk directly to the rim in water gardens. Although plants prefer constant moisture, they grow surprisingly well in average garden soils, albeit less vigorously. Soils should never be allowed to dry out. Remove seed pods before they mature to prevent any unwanted self-seeding. Seeds that mature and drop into water can float to other locations.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Iris pseudacorus, commonly called yellow flag, is a rhizomatous beardless wetland iris that is native to Europe, northern Asia, the Middle East and northern Africa. It has naturalized in much of North America, particularly in the eastern U.S. It is at home in wet soils, typically forming large colonies along streams, ponds and marshes. It grows in expanding clumps to 3-4’ (less frequently to 5’) tall and to 30” wide. Bright yellow flowers (3-4” across), with a darker yellow zone and brown or violet veining on each fall, bloom in late spring to early summer on rigid, upright, branched stalks. Each flower stalk bears 4-12 flowers. Flowers give way to large seed pods. Sword-shaped, gray green leaves (1 1/8” wide). Plant roots have been used in the past for a variety of purposes including medical treatments, dyes, inks, and snuff. Plant seeds have been used as a coffee substitute (no caffeine however).Genus named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow.Specific epithet means false Acorus as the rhizomes resemble those of Acorus.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Soil needs to stay relatively dry in summer in order for the bulbs to set buds for the following year. Plant bulbs 3-4” deep and space 3-4” apart in fall. Bulbs tend to separate into offsets or bulblets after bloom (particularly when planted shallowly), with each new bulblet requiring several years to mature. Although bulbs can be dug and divided (offsets removed) after bloom, it is probably best to do this only if flowering has significantly declined. In order to insure consistent flowering from year to year, it is an option to plant supplemental bulbs each fall, or to grow this plant as an annual by planting new bulbs each fall.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Iris reticulata, commonly called reticulated iris, is a bulbous perennial iris that is native to Turkey, the Caucasus, Northern Iraq and Iran.  It is a low-growing purple-flowered reticulate or netted iris that blooms in March to early April in the St. Louis area, at about the same time as snowdrops (Galanthus), glory-of-the-snow (Chionodoxa) and the early crocuses.  Striking purple 2.5” diameter flowers with gold crests and white streaks on the falls appear on naked stems (scapes) typically growing to 6-8"" tall.  Flowers have a sweet fragrance.  Narrow, linear, 4-sided, grass-like leaves (usually 2-4 per plant) typically rise to the same level as the flower at the time of bloom, but elongate to 12-15” after bloom before eventually disappearing by late spring as the plant goes dormant.Genus named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow.Specific epithet is in reference to the netted or reticulate pattern on the dry bulbs.

Best grown in rich, well-composted, humusy, medium moisture, neutral to slightly alkaline, well-drained soils in full sun.  Best flowering and disease resistance occur in full sun.  Plants will tolerate light shade.  Best with consistent moisture during growth periods, but avoid wet soils.  Many spurias are summer dormant and need much less moisture after bloom (growth in summer often stops during hot weather and plants can survive with little watering).  Good soil drainage is essential to combat potential soft rot problems.  Avoid use of mulch for the same reason.  Heavy clay soils such as those present in much of the St. Louis area should be amended prior to planting (e.g., add gypsum, coarse sand, organic matter) or raised plantings should be considered.  Plant rhizomes shallowly (about 2"" deep) and about 24” apart in mid to late summer (July to early September).  Fertilize regularly in spring prior to bloom.  Avoid overhead watering.  Deadhead individual spent flowers and remove flowering stems to the ground after bloom.  Divide plants immediately after flowering when overcrowding occurs (every 3-4 years).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Iris spuria, commonly called salt marsh iris or butterfly iris, is a tall, rhizomatous, beardless iris that is native to central and southern Europe and from Algeria to Iran.  It is one of the tallest members of the iris family, with stems typically rising to 3' (occasionally to 5') tall.  Stalk height is often reduced in cold winter climates.  Grows in clumps with attractive narrow linear leaves (to 3-4' long).  Flowers on species plants typically have bluish-purple to lilac segments with falls sometimes having a yellow ridge.  Color variations expand the color range to include white, blue, purple, wine and brown.Genus named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow.Specific epithet means false.
","
Problems
A major insect pest of spuria iris is iris borer.  Other potential insect problems include iris weevil, slugs, snails, thrips, whiteflies and verbena bud moth.  Major disease problems include bacterial soft rot, crown rot fungus,  rhizome rot, and fungal leaf spot.  Watch for mottling of leaves and flowers which may indicate the presence of mosaic virus.  Mustard seed fungus can be fatal.  Good sanitation practices are the most important component of any disease/insect control program:  promptly remove and destroy diseased foliage/rhizomes, promptly remove and destroy borer-infected foliage/rhizomes and perform an annual clean-up of all debris and foliage from beds in fall after frost.  The most frequent causes of failure to flower or sparse flowering are (1) rhizomes are planted too deep, (2) plants are located in too much shade, (3) plants were given too much fertilizer or (4) plants have become overcrowded and need division.
","
Garden Uses
Sunny beds and borders.  Will naturalize into large clumps.

Culture
Grow in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Prefers sheltered sunny locations, as near a south or west facing wall. Plant rhizomes only about 1-2"" below the soil. Rhizomes tend to push out of the ground and will benefit from fall and spring mulches.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Iris tectorum is a 15"" tall species of the crested iris group featuring large, 6"" across, beardless, bright lilac-purple flowers with falls which are crested white. Foliage is arranged in fans of narrow, lance-shaped, ribbed, glossy, upright leaves that can become somewhat floppy. Can spread rapidly in the garden. Commonly called roof iris because it has in the past been grown on thatched roofs in both Japan and China.Genus named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow.Specific epithet means of the roofs of houses.
","
Problems
Susceptible to a virus which discolors the leaves badly. Remove and destroy infected plants. Seed will be virus-free and can be collected for future planting. Also subject to slugs.
","
Garden Uses
Because of its preference for sheltered, sunny areas, this iris can solve a planting problem in areas of the garden where there is limited air circulation. It also may be effective when planted in the rock garden or in large drifts at the front of the perennial border. The ribbed leaves add texture to the garden.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Iris veriscolor, commonly called northern blue flag, is a clump-forming iris that is native to marshes, swamps, wet meadows, ditches and shorelines from Manitoba to Nova Scotia south to Virginia, Ohio, Illinois and Minnesota.  It is a marginal aquatic plant that forms a clump of narrow, arching-to-erect, sword-shaped, blue-green leaves (to 24” long and 1” wide).  Flowering stalks rise from the clump to 30” tall in late spring, with each stalk producing 3-5 bluish-purple flowers (to 4"" wide) with bold purple veining.  Falls (sepals) have a central yellow blotch surrounded by a white zone.  Clumps spread slowly by tough, creeping rhizomes.   Northern blue flag thrives in wetland habitats frequented by rushes and  sedges (the ""flag"" part of the common name comes from the middle English word flagge meaning rush or reed).  Rhizome is poisonous.Genus named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow.Specific epithet means having various colors.
","
Problems

Sow seed in spring or late summer in rich, well-drained soils in full sun.  Readily self-seeds in the landscape.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Isatis tinctoria, commonly called woad, dyer’s woad, or pastel, is a short-lived perennial or biennial of the mustard family.  It typically grows in the first year as a large-taprooted basal rosette to 12” tall, with branched, alternate-leaved flowering spikes rising above the basal rosette in the second year to 2-4’ tall.  This plant primarily features alternate leaves, yellow flowers, pendant brown seed pods and a blue dye which can be extracted from the foliage.  It is native to Europe and southwestern Asia.  It was brought to Plymouth Colony in the early 1600s by European immigrants, and over time has been distributed to and naturalized in parts of northeastern Canada, New England and western North America from British Columbia and Montana south to California and New Mexico.  In the western U.S., it is commonly found today in a variety of habitats including rangelands, agricultural lands, pastures, fields, roadsides and disturbed sites.  

Foliage consists of basal rosettes of stalked, oblong-lanceolate, gray-green leaves (each to 2-4” but sometimes to 7” long) and stalkless, smaller, alternate, arrow-shaped, gray-green leaves (each to 2” long) borne on leafy flowering stems rising above the basal foliage in the second year to 4’ tall.  Four-petaled yellow flowers (each to 3/8” across) bloom in early summer in loose 3-inch long racemes which collectively form a large terminal panicle.  Flowers are followed by dark pendant decorative seed pods.  Leaves produce a blue pigment.   

Woad has been grown as a dye plant for its indigo blue pigment since the Stone Age and has been additionally cultivated for its medicinal properties in Europe since the 1200s.  This plant was the sole source of a quality blue dye used in Europe from ancient times (e.g., cloth dye or body paint used by the Britons and Celts) until Indigofera tinctoria (true indigo) became available from the Orient as a less expensive, competing source.  The blue pigment is obtained from woad leaves by fermentation and oxidation of a colorless glucoside known as indican.  Indican is also present in the leaves of the unrelated true indigo which was brought by land to Europe from Asia beginning in Greco-Roman times, but did not become a significant competing source to woad in Europe until Vasco de Gamma discovered the sea route from India to Europe.  By the mid-1600s, true indigo largely replaced woad as the blue dye of Europe.  The chemical blue dye extracted from woad is commonly called indigo which is the same blue dye, albeit in stronger concentrations, that is extracted from true indigo. 

Notwithstanding its blue dye properties, woad was also used in times dating back to ancient Greece and Rome where plants were used for a variety of medicinal purposes including antiseptic wound treatments, fever reduction, and ulcers.Genus name is the classical Greek name for this plant.  It was cultivated in Britain up to about 1930 for production of a blue vegetable dye.  It is much less in demand today for commercial dye purposes because of the creation of synthetic dyes which have now taken its place, as well as the place of Indigofera tinctoria, as a main source of blue dye.Specific epithet from Latin means used in dyeing.Woad is a common name for this plant plus the name of the blue dye extracted from the leaves of the plant.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Adaptable to shade. Prefers moist, humusy soils, but tolerates a wide range of soil conditions. Can form dense colonies by root suckering if left unchecked.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Itea virginica, commonly called Virginia sweetspire, is an erect, rounded, broad-spreading, deciduous shrub with arching branches. Typically grows 3-4' (less frequently to 5') tall with a similar spread. Features fragrant, tiny white flowers borne in cylindrical, drooping racemes (3-6"" long) which cover the shrub with bloom in late spring to early summer. Oval, dark green leaves (1-4"" long) turn varying shades of red, orange and gold in autumn. Long period of fall color, with leaves often persisting on the plants until early winter.Genus name comes from the Greek word for willow in reference to the similarity of the leaves or flower clusters to those of some willows.Specific epithet means of Virginia.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Deer tend to avoid this plant.
","
Garden Uses
A versatile shrub for sun and shade. Specimen, group or mass. Shrub borders, open woodland gardens, foundations or hedges. Mass for a shrubby ground cover effect. Naturalizes well in wild or informal areas. Also a good selection for wet locations such as low spots or pond/stream margins.

Winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 (possibly 9b). Established trees will usually withstand occasional temperatures down to about 20 degrees F. In the St. Louis area, grow in containers. Best in sandy, fertile, well-drained soils in bright light. Likes heat and humidity. Keep soils evenly moist year around, and never allow soils to dry out. Bring pots indoors each fall before frost for overwintering in a bright cool location. Young plants usually do not flower.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Jacaranda mimosifolia, commonly called jacaranda, is native to Argentina and Bolivia. It is a deciduous tree that grows 25-50’ tall in its native habitat. In tropical and subtropical climates, it puts on a spectacular flowering display in spring to summer wherein blue-purple flowers cover the tree with bloom, forming pools of blue on the ground as they fall. Flowers (to 2” long) appear in 12-inch terminal panicles in spring and early summer. Flowers give way to flattened 2-inch capsules, each containing numerous winged seeds. In St. Louis, jacaranda may only be grown in containers. Container plants often do not bloom, so in areas such as St. Louis, it is grown primarily as a foliage plant. Features large bipinnate compound fern-like leaves (to 18” long) with tiny 1/2-inch leaflets. Sometimes commonly called fern tree. Synonymous with Jacaranda acutifolia.Genus name comes from the Latinized Brazilian name.Specific epithet means with leaves that resemble those of mimosa.

Culture
Best grown in well-drained sandy loams with regular moisture in full sun to part shade. Tolerates full shade but with much reduced flowering. As a vine, it is perhaps best sited where it would receive full winter sun, such as the south side of a building or against a south-facing wall. Tolerant of a wide range of soil conditions. Train as a vine on a support structure or sprawl along the ground. When grown as a ground cover, plants will spread less aggresively in poor, lean soils. Prune as needed in early spring just after flowering is completed. If renovation is needed, cut back hard to 18-24” or replace plants.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Jasminum nudiflorum, commonly called winter jasmine, is a trailing, viny shrub that grows from a central crown. As a shrub, it typically grows in a sprawling mound to 4’ tall with arching branches, and spreads by trailing branches that root as they go along the ground. As a vine, it typically grows to 10-15’. Willowy green stems are attractive in winter. Non-fragrant, bright yellow flowers bloom along the stems in late winter before the leaves. Compound, trifoliolate, dark green leaves with ovate leaflets (to 1.25” long).Genus name is a medieval Latin name for the Persian name yasmin or yasamin.Specific epithet means with flowers coming before the leaves.

Culture
Winter hardy to zones 7 to 10, Jasminum officinale prefer full sun to partial shade and a warm site. They grow well in regular garden soil with moderate levels of soil fertility and moisture, and they need frequent pinching and shaping to control growth. Indoors, jasmine are vigorous growers and most require support. They bloom from spring to fall and rest from October to March. After flowering, they should be pruned drastically. Repot, if necessary, at this time. They require high humidity and plenty of light to flower. Jasmine may be placed outdoors from May to September in partial shade. Keep plants cool in winter and let them rest. Make sure plants receive adequate, generous moisture during the growing season, but with good drainage.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Jasminum officinale, commonly called jasmine, is one of the first plants that comes to mind when one thinks of sweet fragrance. A single jasmine vine can perfume an entire room or garden. It is a sprawling, somewhat twining deciduous shrub, usually pruned heavily to keep its size contained. The foliage is slightly downy with pinnate leaves, having 5 to 9 leaflets. The flowers are white or very pale pink and fragrant from early summer to autumn.Genus name is a medieval Latin name for the Persian name yasmin or yasamin.Specific epithet means sold in shops.
","
Problems
Jasminum officinale is usually trouble free, but you should watch for mealybugs, scale and whitefly. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
In warmer climates, jasmine can be pruned and used as hedging plants. It is not hardy north of zone 7 and should therefore be brought inside in late summer or early fall. With its long blooming time and relatively easy culture, jasmine is a nice addition to an indoor garden or can be used as a container plant on a patio or deck to add fragrance to your outdoor living areas.

Container plants may be brought inside before first fall frost for overwintering in bright sunny rooms of moderate temperature with reduced watering.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Jasminum sambac, commonly called Arabian jasmine, is probably native to India or Southeast Asia where it is a broadleaf evergreen shrub. On a support, it grows as a twining shrubby vine. Unsupported, it grows as a sprawling shrub. Plants feature small, waxy, white, salverform flowers (1” diameter) in clusters (cymes) of 3-12 blooms on downy stems clad with broad-ovate, dark green leaves (to 3” long). Flowers are exceptionally fragrant. In its native territory, this species will grow to as much as 25’ and produce flowers throughout the year. In containers in St. Louis, it usually is grown to 4-5’ with flowers appearing primarily in summer. In China, dried flowers are used to scent jasmine tea. In Hawaii (where commonly called pikake), flowers are used in leis. This species is the national flower of the Philippine Islands.Genus name is a medieval Latin name for the Persian name yasmin or yasamin.Specific epithet come from the Medieval Arabic word zanbaq meaning jasmine flower oil.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Jatropha curcas, commonly called purging nut, Barbados nut or physic nut, is a dioecious small tree or large shrub that grows to 20’ tall. It is native to Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean, but has been widely planted throughout the tropics for a number of commercial uses, perhaps now most predominately for production of biofuel. Maple-like, 3-5 lobed, pale green leaves (to 6” wide) are cordate at the bases. Yellow green flowers bloom in spring. Branches have smooth gray bark and exude watery white latex when cut. Flowers give way to green seed pods, each with 2-3 oily black seeds. Pods mature to yellow-red before splitting open to release seeds. Seeds are inedible, but contain oil that may be used to make candles, soap and biofuel. Harvested seed may be pressed for production of biodiesel. Each square mile of plants can reportedly produce 2,000 barrels of oil per year. The oil content of each seed ranges from 30-40%. Cakes remaining after pressing can be further used for producing biogas and fertilizers. Purging nut is a member of the spurge family and closely related to castor oil plant (Ricinus communis).Genus name from the Greek  words iatros meaning physician and trophe meaning food in reference to the edible seed (in very small quantities) of some species.
","
Problems
No known serious insect or disease problems. Plants are considered to be weedy, particularly in uncultivated lands.
","
Garden Uses
Oily seeds are used to make a variety of products ranging from candles to biofuel to fertilizers. Flowers, stems and leaves have medicinal properties. Plants have been used as living fences in some areas.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Jeffersonia diphylla, commonly called twinleaf, is a somewhat uncommon spring woodland wildflower that is native from New York to Wisconsin south to Alabama and Virginia. It is usually found in limestone soils in rich damp woods. It is a clump-forming plant that typically grows to 8” tall when in flower in early spring, but continues to grow thereafter eventually reaching 18” tall by the time its fruit ripens. Features long-stemmed, blue-green basal leaves (to 6” long) which are deeply divided into two lobes that give the appearance of being two separate leaves, hence the common name. In early spring (April), white cup-shaped flowers (1” diameter) bloom singly atop rigid leafless stalks to 8” tall. Each flower has eight petals. Flowers are somewhat reminiscent of bloodroot, but the plants are unrelated and in different families. Fruit is an interesting pear-shaped dehiscent pod with a lid.Genus name honors Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826), President of the Unites States, plants man and patron of botany with a deep interest in horticulture and farming.Specific epithet means having two leaves or leaflets.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Juglans cinerea, commonly called butternut, is not commonly grown as an ornamental but it is a valued native American tree that is unfortunately becoming increasingly rare in the wild now because of a canker disease (see below). Butternut is similar in appearance to black walnut (see Juglans nigra), except it is generally smaller, its bark is less fissured, it has fewer leaflets per leaf and its nuts are more oval than round. It is native to moist bottomlands, lowland forests and some drier limestone soils in eastern and midwestern North America, from New Brunswick to Minnesota, south to Georgia and Arkansas. In Missouri, it typically occurs in rich woods and along streams in all but the far western parts of the state. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows 40-60’ (less frequently to 100’) tall with an open broadly-rounded crown. Features odd-pinnate compound leaves (to 20” long), each with 11-17 oblong to lanceolate leaflets. Foliage turns an undistinguished yellow in fall. Yellowish green monoecious flowers appear in late spring (May-June), the male flowers in drooping catkins and the female flowers in short terminal spikes. Female flowers give way to clusters of edible oval nuts encased in hairy indehiscent husks. Nuts mature in fall. Nut shells can be hard to crack and the kernels are often small. But the kernels are sweet, oily and tasty, having a buttery flavor as per the common name. Native Americans used the nuts for food and boiled the tree sap for syrup. Butternut wood, though softer than black walnut, was once valued for a variety of uses including paneling, cabinets and furniture. Overharvesting of trees for commercial use plus losses from the canker disease have reduced native tree populations to the point where the butternut is now endangered in most parts of its range. This species is sometimes commonly called white walnut because of the light color of the wood.Genus name comes from the Latin names jovis meaning of Jupiter and glans meaning an acorn.Specific epithet refers to the ash gray color of the bark.
","
Problems
Susceptible to butternut dieback or butternut canker (Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum), which is a usually fatal fungal disease that is devastating butternut trees in the wild. Onset of the disease is often first seen as dying stems and branches in the upper crown. This canker has no cure. Insect pests include butternut curculio, borers, lace bugs, caterpillars and bark beetles. As with black walnut, butternut roots produce chemicals called juglones which are very toxic to certain other plants such as azaleas, rhododendrons, blueberries, peonies and solanaceous crops (tomatoes, peppers, potatoes). Most of the toxicity is limited to within the drip line of the tree, but the area of toxicity typically increases outward as the tree matures.
","
Garden Uses
Butternut is of interest to native plant enthusiasts and for those who wish to harvest the nuts. It is otherwise infrequently planted as an ornamental tree.

Prefers moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun. Intolerant of shade. Difficult to transplant because of deep taproot. May be grown for its edible nuts. Although young trees will sometimes begin producing nuts when only 4-6 years old, it usually takes 20 years before a tree will produce a large crop of nuts.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Juglans nigra, commonly called black walnut, is a large deciduous tree typically growing 75-100’ (less frequently to 125’) tall with and an oval to rounded crown. Mature trees characteristically have long trunks, often with an absence of lower branching. Fissured, sharply ridged, dark gray-black bark forms diamond patterns. Black walnut is native from Massachusetts through southern Ontario to South Dakota south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri, it typically occurs in rich woods, in valleys along streams and in open upland woods throughout the state (Steyermark). Features odd-pinnate compound leaves (to 24” long), each with 13-23 oblong to lanceolate leaflets. The terminal leaflet is often missing. Leaves are late to emerge in spring and early to drop in fall. Leaves are strongly aromatic when crushed. Fall color is an undistinguished yellow. Yellow green monoecious flowers appear in late spring (May-June), the male flowers in drooping hairy catkins and the female flowers in short terminal spikes. Female flowers give way to edible nuts, each being encased in a yellow-green husk. Nuts mature in autumn, falling to the ground where the husks blacken as they rot away. Kernels are edible but hard to extract. Black walnuts are harvested for commercial sale. The wood from this tree is highly valued for a number of commercial uses including cabinets, furniture, gunstocks and fine veneers. It is perhaps the best furniture wood available from any native American tree. Overharvesting of trees for the wood has greatly reduced the native populations in the wild. Native Americans used the nuts for food and boiled the tree sap for syrup. They also reportedly threw the husks into ponds to poison fish, making them easier to catch.Genus name comes from the Latin names jovis meaning of Jupiter and glans meaning an acorn.Specific epithet means black, in reference to the dark bark and nuts.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Potential diseases include anthracnose, bacterial blight, root rot, canker, leaf spot and shoot dieback. Watch for aphids, fall webworm and a variety of foliage chewing caterpillars. Black walnut roots produce chemicals called juglones which are very toxic to certain other plants such as azaleas, rhododendrons, blueberries, peonies and solanaceous crops (tomatoes, peppers, potatoes). Most of the toxicity is limited to within the drip line of the tree, but the area of toxicity typically increases outward as the tree matures. Nuts can be quite messy in fall. Husks can stain clothing and sidewalks.
","
Garden Uses

Culture
Prefers moist, organically rich, well-drained soils in full sun. Intolerant of shade. Difficult to transplant because of deep taproot. Although young trees will sometimes begin producing nuts when only 4-6 years old, it usually takes 20 years before a tree will produce a large crop of nuts. Does not perform well in the hot and humid deep South where, as nut trees go, pecans (see Carya illinoinensis) generally do better.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Juglans regia, commonly called English walnut or Persian walnut, is native to Asia and southeast Europe (Balkans). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows 40-60’(less frequently to 100’) tall with and a spreading rounded crown. This is the tree that is grown commercially in the West Coast states for the walnuts that are sold in stores. It is also grown ornamentally in many parts of the U. S., and is valued for its fine-grained wood that is used to make cabinets, furniture and gunstocks. Bark is gray and smooth. Odd-pinnate compound leaves (to 16” long), each with 5-7 (infrequently to 13) oblong leaflets. Leaves are late to emerge in spring and early to drop in fall. Leaves are strongly aromatic when crushed. Fall color is an undistinguished yellow. Yellowish green monoecious flowers appear in late spring (May-June), the male flowers in drooping hairy catkins and the female flowers in short terminal spikes. Female flowers give way to edible nuts, each being encased in a smooth green husk. Nuts mature in autumn. Nuts are thin-shelled, making the kernels easy to extract. Many cultivars of this species are available in commerce.Genus name comes from the Latin names jovis meaning of Jupiter and glans meaning an acorn.Specific epithet means kingly, in reference to the superior quality of the nuts.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Potential diseases include anthracnose, bacterial blight, root rot, canker, leaf spot and shoot dieback. Watch for fall webworm and a variety of foliage chewing caterpillars. English walnut roots produce chemicals called juglones which are very toxic to certain other plants such as azaleas, rhododendrons, blueberries, peonies and solanaceous crops (tomatoes, peppers, potatoes). Most of the toxicity is limited to within the drip line of the tree, but the area of toxicity typically increases outward as the tree matures. Nuts can be quite messy in fall.

Garden Uses
Large deciduous tree for large landscapes. Nuts may be harvested. Inappropriate as a street tree.

Culture
Easily grown in consistently moist to wet soils in full sun.  Tolerates light shade, but performs best in full sun.  Tolerates heavy soils.  Needs ample moisture, but also does surprisingly well in slightly moist soils that do not dry out.  Plants will spread, sometimes aggressively, by creeping rhizomes to form colonies.  May freely self-seed in optimum growing conditions.   Propagate by division in early spring.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Juncus dudleyi, commonly called Dudley's rush, is an upright, tufted perennial rush that typically rises to 18 -30"" tall on slender, cylindrical, unbranched, light green stems.  It is a somewhat weedy, obligate wetland species that is native throughout North America except for North Carolina, Georgia and Florida.  In Missouri, it is found in calcareous spring branches, borders of streams and ponds, wet meadows, wet sections of prairies and moist ground primarily in the Ozark region of the State (Steyermark).  Each stem has 1-2 thin basal leaves (to 12"" long), and is topped by a compact branched inflorescence containing small clusters of tiny, insignificant, greenish flowers (each less than 1/4"" wide).  Flowers bloom in late spring to mid-summer.  Flowers give way to seed capsules which mature to reddish brown.  Dudley's rush was formerly considered to be a variety of Juncus tenuis (path rush).Genus name means rush.Specific epithet honors William Russell Dudley (1849-1911) who first discovered this plant.

Culture
Easily grown in moist to wet soils in full sun to part shade.  Best in full sun.  Performs well in standing water to 4” deep, but will also grow well in garden soils as long as the soils are in fact kept consistently moist.  Plants will spread in the landscape by rhizomes and by self-seeding.  Rhizomatous spread may be controlled, if desired, by growing this plant in large containers sunk in the ground.  Foliage remains evergreen in warm winter climates or when grown indoors as a houseplant.  In St. Louis, outdoor clumps die to the ground in winter.  Old foliage should be cut back in early spring.  Propagate by seed or division.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Juncus effuses, commonly known as soft rush, common rush, bog rush or mat rush, is a grasslike-like, rhizomatous, wetland perennial that features smooth, upright, cylindrical, unjointed, spire-like green stems (leaves are absent) which grow in spreading basal clumps to 20-40” tall.  It is one of the true rushes. It has a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, being found in many places around the world, but primarily in cool-temperate regions, particularly ones having wet soils. It is often found growing in ditches, bogs, swamps, marshes, wet pastures, and along the margins of lakes and rivers.  It is infrequently found growing in tropical areas.  Stems are usually solid, with the leaves typically reduced to bladeless basal sheathes.  Insignificant, minute, yellowish-green to pale brown flowers bloom in one-sided clusters (many-flowered cymes) located on stem sides slightly below the stem tips.  Flowers emerge in summer (July to September).  Fruit is an obovoid capsule.  Clumps provide vertical accent to moist garden areas.  Although the stems appear from a distance as coarse and stiff, they are soft to the touch.  Soft rush is considered to be a somewhat invasive weed in a number of locations.  Foliage turns yellow in fall before browning up for winter.Genus name means rush.Specific epithet means loose-spreading in probable reference to plant habit.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Rust, leaf spot and stem rots may occur.
","
Garden Uses
Except for certain horticultural varieties, straight species plants are typically not grown as garden plants.  They may be grown at the edge of a pond or water garden, in boggy areas, among wet pebbles or rocks or in several inches of standing water.  Good water garden accent.  Effective in containers.  Interesting plant for transitional waterside areas.  May help control soil erosion on moist banks.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Juncus inflexus, commonly known as hard rush or blue rush, is a rhizomatous, densely-tufted perennial with upright, cylindrical, blue-green stems/leaves. This is a true rush that will grow to as much as 40"" tall. It is native to marshes, wet meadows, flood plains, river/lake margins, wet hillsides (sandy or peaty) and ditches in Europe, Asia and North Africa. It has been introduced in northeastern North America (Ontario, Michigan, New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Virginia). Tiny, straw to reddish-brown flowers in loose cymes bloom at some stem ends in late spring to mid-summer. Flowers give way to short-beaked brown seed capsules. nts in basket weaving.Genus name means rush.Specific epithet means bent inwards.
","
Problems

","
Garden Uses
May be grown at the edge of a pond or water garden, in boggy areas, among wet pebbles or rocks or in several inches of standing water.  Good water garden accent.  Adds a certain amount of authenticity to transitional waterside areas where it also may be used for erosion control.  Also effective in garden areas as long consistent moisture is provided.  May be effective in large combination containers.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium to wet soil in full sun to part shade.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Juncus tenuis, commonly called path rush, is found in the wild throughout North America. Grows to two feet tall. Path rush is found in a wide variety of weedy locations such as in parking lots, fields, thickets, woods, swamps, pastures and along roadsides and paths. Also called wire grass (even though it is a rush) because of its tough stems. Medium green leaves turn brown with frost. Insignificant, tiny flowers are clustered at or near the stem tips.Genus name means rush.Specific epithet means slender or thin.
","
Problems
No significant problems. Needs ample water. Many consider this to be a weed.
","
Garden Uses
May be grown in clumps at edge of a pond or stream, among stones or pebbles, or generally as a novelty. Can also be used as a groundcover and to help control erosion.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerant of a wide variety of soils including clay. Intolerant of wet soils. Tolerant of some drought once established. Also tolerant of many city air pollutants. This juniper is not reliably winter hardy to USDA Zone 5.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Juniperus ashei, commonly called Ashe juniper, is an evergreen large shrub or small tree that is primarily native to central Texas (Edwards Plateau section in particular), with additional populations found in Oklahoma (Arbuckle Mountains and Prior Creek), northern Arkansas, southern Missouri (limestone glades and bald knobs along bluffs of the White River and its tributaries) and northern Mexico. Typically matures to 15-25' tall with a rounded to flattened crown. Trunk usually branches near the base. Gray to reddish brown bark peels in strips. Scale-like green leaves retain good color in winter. Hemispheric raised abaxial glands on the leaves are distinctive. Trees are dioecious (separate male and female plants). Pollen cones on male trees are small and appear at the tips of the branchlets. Berry-like, bluish-purple fruiting cones (usually one seed per fruit) with a white waxy coating appear on female trees. Fruit is eaten by some birds and mammals.Genus name comes from the Latin name for the juniper.Specific epithet honors William Willard Ashe (1872-1932), forester with the U.S. Forest Service and plant collector.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Junipers are generally susceptible to tip and needle blights. Cedar-apple rust and related rust diseases spend part of their life cycle on junipers. Root rot may occur, particularly in wet, poorly drained soils. Canker may attack bark or main stems. Occasional insect pests include aphids, bagworms, webworms and scale. Some people are allergic to pollen produced by male trees.
","
Garden Uses
Native evergreen juniper for sunny areas of the landscape.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Juniperus chinensis, commonly called Chinese juniper, is a dioecious evergreen conifer that is native to China, Japan, Mongolia and the Himalayas. It is often seen in the wild as a conical tree to 50’ tall and 20’ wide, but also appears in much shorter shrubby or spreading forms. Foliage is dark green. Brown bark on mature stems peels in strips. Although species plants are rarely sold in commerce, a large number of cultivated varieties ranging in size from large trees to large/small shrubs to low-growing groundcovers have become popular ornamental landscape plants. Chinese juniper leaves come in two types: scale-like (adult) and awl/needle-like (juvenile). Cones (pollen and seed-bearing) appear on different plants. Male plants produce catkin-like pollen cones. Female plants produce fleshy, berry-like, whitish-blue seed cones that usually acquire violet-brown tones as they mature over two years.Genus name comes from the Latin name for the juniper.Specific epithet means of China.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Junipers are generally susceptible to tip and needle blights. Cedar-apple rust and related rust diseases spend part of their life cycle on junipers. Root rot may occur, particularly in wet, poorly drained soils. Canker may attack bark or main stems. Occasional insect pests include aphids, bagworms, webworms and scale.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 2-6 where it is best grown in medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Tolerates a wide range of soils, including very poor often rocky soils.  Established plants have good drought tolerance.  Species plants are particularly noted for their superior tolerance for cold temperatures and superior intolerance for heat and humidity.  Plants will survive in the wild within the Arctic Circle, but are not recommended for planting in locations south of USDA Zone 6.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Juniperus communis, commonly called common juniper, is a dioecious, needled, evergreen conifer that grows in a variety of different shapes and forms in cool to cold areas of the Northern Hemisphere plus in one isolated population growing in the Atlas Mountains of Africa.  It is the most widespread conifer growing in the world today.  It is primarily native to coniferous forests, alpine open areas and plains in a circumpolar distribution which includes sites in Europe, Asia and North America, extending in some cases to within the Arctic Circle.  In North America, it is widespread from Alaska east to Labrador and Greenland south to Minnesota and New York, extending further south in the Rocky Mountains to Arizona and in the Appalachians to North Carolina.  

Growth habit and form in part depend upon such factors as geographic location, temperature and the amount of exposure to the elements.  However, it is not unusual for a variety of different forms to be found growing together in the same location.  In the U.S., common juniper is most frequently seen as a multi-stemmed shrub (to 5-15’ tall), but is also sometimes seen, particularly in harsh growing conditions, as a prostrate, low-growing, spreading shrubby plant (to 9-12” tall).  Infrequently it appears as a medium-sized tree rising to as much as 45’ tall.  Prickly, green, needle-like juvenile leaves grow in whorls of three.  A glaucous stomatal band appears on each adaxial leaf surface.  Adult foliage never appears.  Exfoliating bark is often an attractive reddish-brown.  Small yellow spring flowers (April-June) are not ornamentally attractive, but give way on female plants to slightly glaucous, spherical, 1/2” diameter seed cones (fruits) which are commonly referred to as juniper berries.  Berries emerge green but gradually ripen by fall to a waxy dark blue to black.  Each berry usually contains two or three seeds and ripens in the 2nd or 3rd year.  Berries are used for a number of purposes including, perhaps most notably, as the dominant flavoring of gin (the alcoholic beverage).Genus name comes from the Latin name for the juniper.Specific epithet means common.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Juniper blight can be a serious problem on many of the different species of juniper, but is less frequently a problem on J. communis.  Lesser problems include cedar apple rust and wilt.  Insect problems include mites, borers, scale, midges and bagworms.
","
Garden Uses
Evergreen ornamental ground cover, shrub or small tree.  Use depends in large part upon form and size.  Species plants are rarely sold in commerce, but a large number of varieties and cultivars are available.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Juniperus conferta, commonly called shore juniper, is a decumbent evergreen shrub that is native to certain sandy coastal areas of Japan and Sakhalin Island (Russia). It is a dense, low-spreading plant that grows 10-18” tall and spreads by creeping, branched stems over time to 6-8’ wide. It is noted for its attractive, aromatic, awl-shaped, blue-green foliage featuring spiny-pointed blue-green needles (to 5/8” long) in groups of three. Fleshy, blackish, berry-like seed cones acquire a silvery bloom at maturity.Genus name comes from the Latin name for the juniper.Specific epithet conferta comes from the Latin word for crowded in reference to the foliage.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Junipers are generally susceptible to blights (dieback of stem tips), particularly in unusually rainy/wet springs. Phomopsis twig blight is of particular concern. Cedar-apple and related rust diseases spend part of their life cycle on junipers. Root rot may occur, particularly in wet, poorly drained soils. Occasional insect pests include aphids, bagworms, twig borers, webworms and scale. Watch for spider mites. Foliage on mature plants will sometimes die back in the center. Susceptible to winter injury when temperatures dip below minus 10 degrees F.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Juniperus horizontalis, commonly called creeping juniper, is a procumbent evergreen shrub that is native to Alaska, Canada and the northern U.S. from New England to New York to the Great Lakes, Wyoming and Montana.  Distribution in the northern U.S. is somewhat spotty.  It is typically found growing in rocky or sandy soils including rock outcroppings, stony slopes, coastal cliffs, prairies, sand dunes and stream banks.  It forms a low groundcover that generally rises to 6-18” tall but spreads by long trailing branches with abundant short branchlets to form an often-dense, 4-10’ wide mat.  Foliage is primarily scale-like (adult) with some awl/needle-like (juvenile) needles appearing usually in opposite pairs.  Foliage is typically green to blue-green during the growing season, but often acquires purple tones in winter.  Fleshy seed cones (dark blue berries) generally mature in two years, but are often absent on cultivated plants.Genus name comes from the Latin name for the juniper.Specific epithet is in obvious reference to the horizontal branches.

Culture
In winter hardy zones 10 to 12, kalanchoe should be grown in full sun to moderate shade and prefers light, sandy, open, well-drained soils and is moderately salt tolerant. Needing very little water, kalanchoe only needs one light application of fertilizer each year. Plants should be protected from frost. Plant on 8 to 12-inch centers for the best effect.

As an indoor plant in cooler climates, kalanchoe grows best in full sun or bright indirect light. This plant needs a very well-drained soil. Water thoroughly but let dry between watering. Fertilize actively growing plants with a well-balanced fertilizer or a formulation higher in phosphorus to promote better flowering. Flowering occurs within four months after exposure to six weeks of fourteen hour nights. Ideal temperatures at this time are 60°F at night and 70°F during the day. Too low or too high temperatures may inhibit flowering. Water and fertilize less while initiating flowering or during periods of slow winter growth. Pinch back stems to promote flowering and maintain shape. Protect kalanchoe from gusty winds as this plant is easily blown over by winds hitting the thick large leaves.

New plantlets may occasionally appear at leaf margins and may be removed and potted up individually.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Kalanchoe blossfeldiana, commonly called kalanchoe, is a dark green, succulent perennial with scallop-edged leaves and large umbels of flower clusters held above the foliage. It has an upright, multi-branched growth habit. Their bloom time is incredibly long for a houseplant. These bright red, pink or yellow flower clusters last for weeks.Genus name comes from the corrupted and unintelligible Chinese name of one species of these succulent herbs or sub-shrubs.Specific epithet honors German nurseryman Robert Blossfeld (1882-1945) active at Potsdam, Germany 1920-1940.
","
Problems
Relatively trouble free, but check for mealybug, mites and scale. Susceptible to stem rot, if over-watered. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
Kalanchoe, when container grown, are ideal for sunrooms and bright windowsills and can be grown on the porch or patio.

Raised plantings should be considered in order to promote better drainage.  Plants do not grow well in heavy clay soils.  Remove spent flower clusters immediately after bloom.  Prune lightly after bloom to promote bushy growth.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Kalmia latifolia, commonly called mountain laurel, is a gnarled, multi-stemmed, broadleaf evergreen shrub or small tree that is native to Eastern North America (New England south to the southern Indiana, Louisiana and the Florida panhandle) where it is found in a variety of habitats including open rocky or sandy woods, cool meadows, balds, mountain slopes and woodland margins.  It is noted for its excellent spring flowers and quality year round foliage.  It typically grows as a dense rounded shrub to 5-15’ tall, opening up and developing gnarly branches with age.  Notwithstanding its usual shrub habit, mountain laurel will rarely grow as a small tree (particularly on slopes in the Appalachian Mountains) to as much as 30’ tall.  Flowers appear in terminal clusters (corymbs to 6” across), typically covering the shrub in late May-June for several weeks with an often exceptional bloom.  Each flower (to 1” across) is cup shaped with five sides and ranges in color from rose to white with purple markings inside.  If not deadheaded, flowers give way to non-showy brown fruits (3/16” dehiscent capsules) that persist into winter.   Elliptic, alternate, leathery, glossy evergreen leaves (to 5” long) are dark green above and yellow green beneath and reminiscent to the leaves of rhododendrons.  All parts of this plant are toxic if ingested. Kalmia latifolia is the state flower of Connecticut.  

Mountain laurel has acquired a number of different common names over time including ivy bush, spoonwood, calico bush and American laurel.  Linnaeus named the genus herein after Swedish botanist Peter Kalm (1716-1779) who explored plant life in parts of eastern North America from 1747 to 1751.Genus name honors Pehr Kalm (1715-1779), Finnish pupil of Linnaeus, who was sent by the Swedish government in 1748 to report on the natural resources of North America.Specific epithet means broad-leaved.
","
Problems
Susceptible to leaf spots and blights. Also susceptible to borers, scale, white fly and lace bugs.
","
Garden Uses
Superior flowering shrub for groups or massing in shrub borders, cottage gardens, woodland areas or wild/naturalized areas.  Hedge.  Foundations.  Compliments rhododendrons and azaleas.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Kalopanax septemlobus, commonly called castor aralia or tree aralia, is the only large tree found in the aralia family. Its large leaves are reminiscent of castor bean. This deciduous tree typically grows to 40-60’ tall with an upright oval habit. In its native habitat, it occurs in cool, moist forest areas and may reach 90-100’ tall. Palmate, toothed, glossy, dark green leaves (7-14” wide) have 5-7 lobes (septemlobus meaning 7 lobes). Leaves turn dull yellow to red in fall, but are not particularly showy. Trunk, branches and particularly the younger stems are armed with spines. Spines tend to disappear from the trunk and larger branches as the tree matures. Tiny white flowers appear profusely in large, terminal, umbel-like panicles (12-24” wide) in late summer. Tiny black fruits in compound clusters ripen in fall. Fruits are attractive to birds. Dark gray bark is ridged and furrowed. Synonymous with Kalopanax pictus.Genus name comes from the Greek word kalos meaning beautiful and Panax the name of a related genus.Specific epithet means have 7 lobes.

Single, five-petaled, rose-like, yellow flowers (to 1 1/2” diameter) bloom somewhat profusely in spring. Double-toothed, narrow, ovate-lanceolate, bright green leaves (to 4” long) turn yellow in fall.Genus name honors William Kerr (d. 1814), Kew gardener and collector, who collected in China, Java and the Philippines.Specific epithet means of Japan.Plants in the genus Kerria are sometimes also commonly called Easter rose because the flowers typically bloom around Easter time and resemble roses.‘Albescens’ features creamy yellow flowers (to 2” diameter) with irregularly shaped petals. It typically grows to 4-5' tall. Foliage turns pale yellow in fall.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zone 10 where it may be grown in moist, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade.  Best with consistent water.   Established trees have some drought tolerance.  Marginally sub-tropical (can stand brief temperatures down to 28 degrees F).
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Kigelia africana, commonly called sausage tree, is native to riverbanks, floodplains, open woodlands and savannas from sub-Saharan central Africa to South Africa.  It typically grows to 50-60' tall with a stout trunk and rounded to spreading crown.  Smooth, gray-brown bark may flake with age.  Rough, pinnate-compound, yellowish-green leaves (to 8"" long), with each leaf having 3-8 leaflets.  Inflorescence is a pendant panicle (to 3-6' long) of wrinkled, bell-shaped, dark red flowers (5 lobes each).  Flowers have abundant nectar and a fetid aroma.  Flowers open at night and are pollinated by bats (sometimes also by hawk moths and birds).  Flowers are followed by woody, gray-brown fruits (to 24"" long, 4"" diameter and 20+ pounds each) which look like very large sausages vertically suspended on long stems.  Ripe and unripe fruits are poisonous (cause formation of blisters in mouth and on skin).  Historically, parts of sausage tree have been used in a variety of applications including (a) herbal medicines for treating infections, wounds and digestive/respiratory problems, (b) treatment of ulcers, sores and syphilis, (c) skin ointments from fruit extracts, (d) yellow dye from the roots, (e) seeds are roasted and eaten in times of food shortage, (f) wood for shelving and fruit boxes, and (g) dugout canoes which are literally dug out from tree trunks (in Botswana the canoes are called makoros or mokoros).Genus name comes from the kigeli-keia, the Mozambican name for sausage tree.Specific epithet means of Africa.
","
Problems
No significant insect or disease problems.  Large falling fruits can cause damage to people or cars.
","
Garden Uses
Where winter hardy, it can be grown as a shade tree or to stabilize riverbanks. Also is an attractive and unusual ornamental tree which is grown in tropical areas around the world for enjoyment of its night-blooming, cup-shaped, red flowers, its large sausage-like fruits and its spreading shape. It would be very difficult to grow in a tub as a houseplant.

Culture
Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Prefers rich, humusy soils. Intolerant of wet, heavy soils. Locate in areas protected from wind. Promptly remove spent flower spikes. Crowns benefit from winter protection in USDA Zones 5 and 6 (mulch or tie leaves together forming a canopy over the crown so as to prevent water from settling on the crown and freezing). Established clumps are best left undisturbed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Kniphofia uvaria, commonly known as red-hot poker or torch lily, is an upright, clump-forming, rhizomatous perennial that is native to South Africa.  From an 18-24"" tall basal tuft of coarse, linear, sword-shaped, semi-evergreen, bluish-green leaves (to 3' long and 1"" wide) arises a succession of thick, naked flower scapes (typically to 3-4' tall) with dense terminal racemes (6-10"" long) of drooping, tubular flowers.  Buds and emerging flowers are red but mature to yellow, giving each spike a two-toned appearance.  Flowers bloom from late spring to early summer.  

Common names refer to the purported resemblance of each flower spike to a red hot poker or torch.Genus name honors Johann Hieronymus Kniphof (1704-1763) German physician and botanist.Specific epithet means like a bunch of grapes.
","
Problems
No significant insect or disease problems.  Watch for root rot in poorly-drained soils. Thrips may appear in some areas.

Culture
Easily grown in dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Thrives in rocky or gritty soils. Needs superior drainage. Tolerates drought. Avoid wet and/or heavy soils or shade. May be grown from seed which can be scattered on the ground for large plantings in fields. Will self-seed in optimum growing conditions. Junegrass grows to mature height and flowers by June, but thereafter may go dormant in hot and humid summer climates. In cool summer climates, it will usually remain attractive until fall. Plants may be short-lived. Cold hardiness depends upon the area from where the seed was harvested.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Koeleria macrantha, commonly called prairie junegrass, is a cool season, clump-forming, tufted, perennial bunch grass that is native throughout most of the contiguous U.S. except for the Southeast and parts of the Northeast. It is also found in Europe and Asia. In Missouri, it is typically found in dry prairies and open woods in the southwestern and central parts of the state (Steyermark). It typically grows in a compact, erect clump to 2’ tall. Mostly basal leaves (to 7” long) are medium to bright green, but may be tinged with gray-green. Narrow tapered inflorescences (to 5” long) appear in late spring atop flower spikes rising well above the basal foliage. Inflorescences open light green but change to silver-green as the seed heads mature.Genus name honors German botanist and grass expert Georg Ludwig Koeler (1765-1807).Specific epithet means large-flowered.
","
Problems
No significant insect or disease problems. Occasional problems include rusts, leaf spots and blights.
","
Garden Uses
Best for massing and naturalizing in fields or prairies where self-seeding is not a problem. Mix with other ornamental grasses. Potential for summer/fall dormancy makes this questionable for placement in conspicuous parts of borders.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Koelreuteria paniculata, commonly called golden raintree, is a small, open-branching, irregularly-shaped, deciduous tree with a rounded crown which typically grows 30-40' tall and as wide. Features pinnate or bipinnate, feathery, compound leaves (to 18"" long), each leaf having 7-17 irregularly lobed leaflets. Leaves emerge pinkish bronze to purplish in spring, mature to a bright green in summer and turn yellow (quality variable) in fall. Bright yellow flowers (1/2"" wide) appear in early summer in long, terminal, panicles (12-15""). Falling blossoms may or may not resemble ""golden rain"", but the fallen blossoms often form an attractive golden carpet under the tree. Flowers give way to interesting, brown, papery seed capsules which somewhat resemble Chinese lanterns.Genus name honors Joseph Gottlieb Koelreuter (1733-1806), professor of natural history at Karlsruhe, a pioneer experimental investigator of plant hybridization.Specific epithet means in a panicle in reference to the floral inflorescence.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Foliage of this cultivar reportedly produces best color in sun-filtered part shade locations. Prune out dead wood as needed. Shrub stems tend to become dense and overgrown after several years, in which case thinning stems or cutting back all stems to the ground may be advisable. Hard prunings to the ground may be performed in late winter or immediately after flowering. Plants bloom on old wood, so hard pruning in late winter will result in loss of bloom for the season, but plants stems will grow taller during the season.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Kolkwitzia amabilis, commonly called beautybush, is a member of the honeysuckle family. It is closely related to Weigela and Diervilla. It is primarily grown for its outstanding spring flowers. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows 6-10’ tall with an arching, vase-shaped habit. Bell-shaped, pink flowers with yellow throats appear in clusters (corymbs to 3” wide) in a profuse mid-spring bloom (late April to early May in St. Louis). Flowers are followed by capsule-like fruits that usually persist on the plants. Broad-ovate dark green leaves (to 3” long) turn an undistinguished yellow in fall. Exfoliating bark on mature stems provides some winter interest.Genus name honors Richard Kolkwitz (b. 1873), professor of botany in Berlin c. 1900.Specific epithet means lovely.

Culture
Tender perennial that is winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 where it may be left in the ground year-round. In St. Louis, it is grown as an annual vine. It is easily grown in average, medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Plant seed directly in the garden after last frost date or start seeds indoors 6-8 weeks earlier. Needs a sturdy support structure on which to grow due to the weight of the vine at maturity. Collect seed in fall for planting the following year.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lablab purpureus, commonly called hyacinth bean, is an ornamental twining vine with handsome, purple-tinged, trifoliate leaves. It rapidly grows to 20' and will easily cover a trellis in a single season. Spikes of fragrant pea-like bright rose-purple flowers (sometimes white or pink) are followed in late summer by flat, glossy, ruby-purple seed pods (to 6” long). Young immature pods can be cooked and eaten. These plants are widely grown in northern Africa and parts of Asia as a vegetable crop for the flowers, leaves, immature seeds and edible pods. Mature, dried seeds are toxic due to high levels of cyanogenic glucosides and should be boiled in two changes of water before eating to remove the toxins. Given a sunny location, it will bloom continuously throughout the summer.Specific epithet means purple.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems though it is much beloved by Japanese beetles, which can make the leaves resemble Swiss cheese. Vines survive, however, and produce handsome new foliage for late season enjoyment.
","
Garden Uses
Annual vine for covering walls, trellises or fences. Good annual privacy vine for porches. Effective ground cover. Containers. Vegetable gardens.

Culture
Best grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Best in full sun, but appreciates some part afternoon shade in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area. Performs poorly in the heat and humidity of the deep South (south of USDA Zone 7). Best performance generally occurs in climates such as the Pacific Northwest where both summer and winter temperature are moderate. In St. Louis, it is best sited in a protected location to minimize risk of damage from sub-zero winter temperatures. If trained as a small tree, root suckers must be removed as they appear. Also consider removing the seedpods as they appear because they are not particularly ornamental, they consume plant energies and they are quite poisonous.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Laburnum alpinum, commonly called scotch laburnum, is a small deciduous tree or large shrub that is most noted for its pendulous axillary racemes of yellow, wisteria-like flowers that bloom in spring. It typically grows 15-25’ tall as a rounded tree and somewhat shorter as a shrub. Bright yellow, pea-shaped flowers in drooping racemes to 15” long bloom in mid-spring. Flowers give way to winged seed pods (2-3” long). Trifoliate, clover-like, glossy, medium to dark green leaves (to 3” long) produce little fall color. All parts of the tree are poisonous if ingested. Notwithstanding the common name, this species is not native to Scotland. It is native to the southern Alps, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.Genus name is the Latin name.Specific epithet means alpine.
","
Problems
Twig blight is an infrequent but potentially serious disease. Canker and leaf spot are lesser disease problems. Watch for aphids and mealybugs.
","
Garden Uses
Small specimen tree or shrub for location around residential homes. Shrub borders. Group as a shrub to maximize effect of the spring bloom. Good background plant.

Culture
Best grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Sharp soil drainage is particularly important. Best in full sun in the northern part of its growing range, but appreciates part afternoon shade in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area. Performs poorly in the heat and humidity of the deep South (south of USDA Zone 7). Best performance generally occurs in climates such as the Pacific Northwest where both summer and winter temperature are moderate. In St. Louis, it is best planted in protected locations to minimize risk of damage from sub-zero winter temperatures. If trained as a small tree, root suckers must be removed as they appear. Also consider removing the seedpods as they appear because they are not particularly ornamental, they consume plant energies and they are quite poisonous.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Laburnum anagyroides, called common laburnum or golden chain tree, is a small, low-branched, deciduous tree or large shrub that is native to the mountains of central and southern Europe. It typically grows to 15-25' tall. It is perhaps most noted for its profuse and showy late spring bloom of yellow flowers in dense, pendulous, wisteria-like racemes (to 4-8"" long). Trifoliate leaves with elliptic-lanceolate to obovate leaflets (each to 3"" long) are a dull green to gray green with pubescence underneath. Foliage produces no significant fall color. Pea-like fruits in seed pods to 2"" long ripen in fall. All parts of this plant, particularly the seeds, are very poisonous (cytisine). An additional common name of golden rain is popular for this tree in Europe, but not in the U.S. where golden rain is usually reserved for Koelreuteria paniculata. The title character in Daphne du Maurier's novel, My Cousin Rachel (1951), may have killed her husband Ambrose with laburnum seeds.Genus name is the Latin name.Specific epithet means resembling the genus Anagyris.
","
Problems
Twig blight is an infrequent but potentially serious disease. Canker and leaf spot are lesser disease problems. Watch for aphids and mealybugs. Use gloves when working with this plant. Educate children as to poisonous plant properties.
","
Garden Uses
Small specimen tree. Also may be grown as a large shrub. Train for arbors, pergolas or espaliers. Good background plant. Plant on an incline or slope to help prevent the development of excess soil moisture. Laburnum x watereri is a popular hybrid of L. anagyroides x L. alpinum. It is generally considered to be a better landscape plant that either parent and produces fewer seed pods.

Culture
Annual/biennial that is best grown in moist to wet soils in part shade to full shade.  Needs constant moisture.  Remains in the wild by self-seeding.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lactuca floridana, commonly called Florida blue lettuce or wild lettuce, is an annual/biennial that typically grows to 2-7’ tall.  It is native to moist to wet open woods, thickets, disturbed sites, waste ground, streambanks, roadsides and railroads in North America from Manitoba and Ontario south through New York to Florida and through South Dakota to Texas. Although related to Latuca sativa (edible lettuce of salads), this woodland lettuce has a bitter flavor and is not commonly eaten.  Young basal leaves may be added raw to salads.  Older leaves may be cooked as greens.  

Deeply-lobed, pinnately veined, lanceolate to triangular, dandelion-like, basal leaves (to 3-10” long and 1-4” wide) have pointed tips, toothed margins and tapered bases.  Smaller upper leaves are lanceolate.  Leafy purplish stems to 7’ tall rise from the basal clump in spring topped by large branching inflorescences of pale blue flowers (hence the common name of Florida blue lettuce) which bloom, only several at a time, from July to October.  Each inflorescence is in the form of a loose panicle of 11-17 flowers (each to 1/2” across) featuring small, petal-like, pale blue (sometimes close to white) rays with no center disks.  Flowers give way to flattened short-beaked achenes featuring white fluffy bristles (pappus).  Plants will secrete a milky sap if bruised or cut.Genus name comes from the Latin word lac meaning milk in obvious reference to the milky plant sap.Specific epithet means of Florida.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Potential disease problems include downy mildew, powdery mildew, shot hole, bottom rot, septoria leaf spot, Botrytis and wilt.   Potential insect pests include aphids, snails, slugs, leafminers and whiteflies.  Mosiac virus may appear.
","
Garden Uses
Somewhat weedy annual/biennial with limited ornamental value.  Best grown in moist shady areas.  May be grown in vegetable gardens.

Culture
Easily grown in fertile, well-composted, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Leaves appreciate some light shade in the heat of the summer. Plants perform best with consistent watering throughout the growing season. Lettuce grows best in cool weather. Start seed indoors about 6-8 weeks prior to last spring frost date. Seed may also be planted directly in the ground about 2 weeks prior to the last spring frost date. Additional seed may also be planted in the ground from last spring frost date to mid June at two week intervals for purposes of extending the harvest season. Plant seed in late summer for a fall crop. Dry soils often trigger bolting.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lettuce types include romaine, butter head, iceberg, and loose leaf. All are at their best if grown quickly.Genus name comes from the Latin word lac meaning milk in obvious reference to the milky plant sap.Specific epithet means cultivated.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Potential disease problems include downy mildew, powdery mildew, shot hole, bottom rot, septoria leaf spot, Botrytis and wilt. Potential insect pests include aphids, snails, slugs, leafminers and whiteflies. Mosiac virus may appear.
","
Garden Uses
Eating lettuce for salads. Also ornamentally effective in beds and borders or as an edger. May be grown in containers with other cool weather annuals such as petunias and pansies.

Culture
This annual vine can easily be grown from seed. Seed may be planted outdoors when soil temperatures have reached 70 degrees F. , which typically occurs shortly after the last spring frost date. Plant several seeds together in mounds to 3' apart if growing on supports, but to 4-6' apart if growing along the ground. Thin later. This vine needs a long growing season for production of quality mature fruit, so seed may be started indoors in peat pots several weeks prior to last spring frost date. Plants generally prefer light, sandy or loamy, well-drained soils in full sun with some light afternoon shade. Best performance occurs with consistent moisture. Flowers bloom at night, and hand pollination often improves fruit set. Plants have good tolerance for hot and humid summers. Let stems scramble along the ground if space is available. Otherwise grow on support structures. If gourds are to be harvested for ornamental purposes, vines should be grown on support structures that are strong enough to keep fruit from touching the ground. Cut some stem section with each mature fruit when harvesting in fall.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lagenaria siceraria, a hardshell gourd, is probably native to Africa, but has been domesticated since ancient times in a number of semi-tropical to tropical areas around the globe. Mature fruits appear in variety of different shapes, including rounded, dumbbell-shaped, bottle-shaped or crookneck-shaped. Vines that produce rounded fruits are often called calabash gourd and vines that produce more cylindrical fruits are often called bottle gourd. Vines may be grown trailing along the ground, along fences or on strong trellises or other upright supports. Each vine will typically grow to 10-16' long clad with large, hairy, broad-ovate, entire to shallowly-lobed, dark green leaves (to 12"" by 12"") with two-branched tendrils and night-blooming, trumpet-shaped, white summer flowers (pale yellow bases). Fruit (a pepo to 3' long) has a smooth, light green skin when young, but matures to yellow or light brown. Many gourds are edible (like zucchini) when young, but some varieties are bitter and inedible. Inner white pulp dries when fruits mature, leaving a hard shell with very little else inside except the seeds. The hard shells of mature fruits are waterproof, and they can be dried and used for a variety of different non-food purposes including containers (water jugs, planters, cups, bowls), floats (fish nets), smoking pipes, musical instruments or ornamental decoration (native artifacts).Genus name comes from the Greek word lagenos meaning a flask.
","
Problems
Potential insect problems include aphids, cucumber beetles, squash bugs, stink bugs, cutworms, pickleworm and squash vine borers. Potential disease problems include anthracnose, fusarium wilt, bacterial wilt, downy mildew, powdery mildew and blights.
","
Garden Uses
Young shoots and leaves can be cooked. Seeds make an interesting addition to soups. Hard shells of mature fruits have a number of non-food uses.

Culture
Best grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun.  Does well in loamy, clay soils with good drainage.  Benefits from a slow release fertilizer.  Overly fertile soils tend to produce lush foliage growth at the expense of flowering with somewhat increased susceptibility to winter injury.  Water roots deeply, particularly in dry spells, but avoid wetting the foliage.  Plant in protected locations and apply a winter mulch.  Growing crape myrtles in the St. Louis area can be tricky because the above ground branches often die to the ground in winter, particularly when temperatures dip below -5 degrees F.  Above ground branches are considered to be winter hardy to USDA Zone 7, whereas roots are usually but not always hardy to USDA Zone 5.  In the St. Louis area (Zone 6a), some gardeners prefer to grow these plants in somewhat the same manner as buddleias (butterfly bushes) by cutting all stems back to 8” in early spring each year.  Roots will sprout new stems which typically grow 2-4’ tall (sometimes more) by the end of the growing season.  Flowers appear on the new wood.  It is also an option in St. Louis to grow these plants as woody shrubs by pruning them back to live wood in spring at the time new foliage begins to appear (in somewhat the same manner as with some shrub roses).  With protection, top growth will survive some winters, but may still suffer significant injury or die to the ground in harsh winters.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lagerstroemia indica, commonly known as crape myrtle, is an upright, wide-spreading, multi-stemmed, deciduous shrub or small tree in the loosestrife family.  It typically grows to 15-25’ tall.  It is native from the Himalayas through southern China, southeast Asia and Japan, but has naturalized in the U.S. from Virginia to Arkansas south to Texas and Florida.   An additional common name is Lilac of the South in reference to its popularity in southern gardens (USDA Zones 7-9).  Key ornamental features include long bloom period, exfoliating bark and superb fall color.  Terminal, crepe-papery inflorescences (to 6-18” long) of showy flowers with crimped petals bloom in summer (sometimes to frost) on upright branches.  In the wild, flowers are typically rose to red.  Cultivated varieties have expanded the flower color range to include white, pink, mauve, lavender and purple.  Alternate to sub-opposite, thick and leathery, privet-like, elliptic to oblong leaves (to 3"" long) emerge light green often with a tinge of red, mature to dark green by summer and finally turn attractive shades of yellow-orange-red in fall.  Flowers give way to round seed capsules which often persist well into winter.  Smooth pale pinkish-gray bark on mature branches exfoliates with age.  In the St. Louis area where winter injury can be a problem, plants will typically grow to 6-10’ tall.  In the deep South, plants will grow much taller if not pruned back.  Straight species plants are not sold in commerce.  A multitude of named cultivars from dwarf to tree size have been introduced over the years, many of which are hybrids between L. indica and L. faueri.Genus name honors Magnus von Lagerstroem (1691-1759), Swedish botanist, Director of the Swedish East Indies Company and friend of Linnaeus.Specific epithet means of the Indies in reference to native territory.Common name is in reference to the crepe-papery inflorescences and the myrtle-like (Myrtus communis) features of the bark and foliage.
","
Problems
Two main disease problems of crape myrtles are fungal leaf spot and powdery mildew.  Foliage may yellow (chlorosis) in alkaline soils.  Some susceptibility to aphids and scale.  Winter injury, particularly to top growth, often occurs in USDA Zones 5 and 6.
","
Garden Uses
Superb flowering small tree or shrub.  Effective as a specimen or in groups.  Screen or informal hedge in southern areas where above ground winter hardiness is not a concern.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Prefers evenly moist, acidic loams with good drainage. Dislikes wet soils, particularly in winter. Dislikes high heat and humidity, and does best when soils are cool. Also dislikes compacted or poorly drained soils. Unsightly bare patches (often called melting out) may appear in the heat of the summer, particularly in hot and humid climates. If such mid-summer foliage decline occurs, plants may be cut back or sheared to stimulate new foliage growth. Leaf scorch may also occur, particularly if soils are allowed to dry out or if plants are grown in too much sun. When grown as a ground cover, starter plants may be spaced 6-10” apart for quick coverage. Evergreen in mild winter climates, but not in the St. Louis area.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lamium maculatum, commonly called spotted deadnettle, is native to Europe and North Africa to West Asia. It is a mat-forming perennial ground cover that typically grows 5-8” tall but spreads indefinitely over time by sprawling stems which root in the ground as they go. Clusters of tiny, somewhat inconspicuous, two-lipped, red-purple (sometimes white or pink) flowers appear at the stem ends in late spring to early summer. Plants grow vigorously in optimum growing conditions, but are easy to control and are not considered to be too aggressive.Genus name comes from the Greek laimos or lamos meaning throat in reference to the throat-like appearance of the corolla.Specific epithet means spotted.'Beedham's White' features toothed, oval, chartreuse-with-a-white-midrib leaves (to 1"" long). White flowers appear at the stem ends in late spring to early summer.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Aphids and slugs are occasional visitors. Watch for leaf blight and leaf spots. Crown rot may occur in poorly drained, wet soils. Foliage may decline (melt out) in hot and humid summer climates.
","
Garden Uses
Small scale ground cover for shady areas. Intolerant of foot traffic, however. Also effective as an edger, but spread must be controlled. Hanging baskets or containers.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lamprocapnos spectabilis has been a common, old garden favorite for many years.  It is native to Japan.  This is a late spring blooming perennial which typically grows to 24-36"" tall and to 18-24"" wide.   Nodding, puffy, heart-shaped, rose-pink flowers with protruding white inner petals begin bloom in spring before the leaves emerge.  Flowers dangle downward  at regular intervals beneath long arching stems.  Compound, biternate green leaves.  

Synonymous with and formerly known as Dicentra spectabilis.Specific epithet means spectacular or showy.The common name is in reference to the protruding white inner petal on each heart-shaped flower which purportedly gives the flower the appearance of a ""bleeding heart"".
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems.  Some susceptibility to aphid infestations.  Good soil drainage is essential for plant survival.  Foliage goes dormant in summer.
","
Garden Uses
Best for the shaded border or woodland garden. Because foliage goes dormant, it is best to plant this bleeding heart through a loose ground cover or among later developing perennials such as hostas and ferns which will fill in as the bleeding heart foliage begins to die back.

Culture
Top growth winter hardy to USDA Zones 10-11 (roots hardy to Zone 9). In St. Louis, grow as annual bedding plants or in containers that may be overwintered indoors in bright, cool (40s) locations. Container plants can be trained as standards. Easily grown as bedding plants in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates poor soils. Since plants for bedding are relatively inexpensive, most gardeners purchase new plants each spring rather than trying to overwinter ones from the current year. Cultivars generally do not come true from seed, however, so cuttings may be taken in summer from favorite plants for overwintering.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lantana camara, commonly called lantana or shrub verbena, is native to the Central and South America. It is an upright frost-tender shrub that grows 3-6’ tall. It has escaped gardens throughout the world and is considered to be a noxious weed in many frost-free/tropical areas where it can rapidly spread to form dense thickets. It has naturalized in parts of the southern U.S. including southern Florida, the Gulf Coast and southern California. When grown in St. Louis, plants placed out in spring after last frost date may grow to as much as 3-4’ tall by the end of the summer. Tiny 5-lobed flowers in dense hemispherical clusters (to 2” diameter) bloom summer to fall. Flower colors include white, yellow, orange, red and purple, often mixed in the same cluster.

Culture
Winter hardy to USDA Zones 8-10 where plants will thrive outdoors as sprawling, low-growing shrubs featuring continuous bloom throughout the year. Plants are easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Plants tolerate part shade, but best flowering is in full sun. Plants thrive in lean, sandy, slightly-dry soils. In St. Louis, plants must be grown as annuals or in containers that may be overwintered indoors in bright, cool locations. Another option is to take cuttings in late summer from favorite plants for overwintering. Many gardeners elect to purchase new plants each spring in 6-packs rather than trying to overwinter plants or cuttings from the previous year. Container plants are less tolerant of dry soils than plants grown in the ground, and accordingly should be watered regularly and never allowed to dry out.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lantana montevidensis, commonly called trailing lantana or weeping lantana, is native to tropical areas of South America. In frost free areas, it grows as a low, trailing, woody shrub to only 12-20"" tall, but spreads by vine-like stems to 5' wide or more. It is typically grown as a dense ground cover. It features hairy, opposite, coarsely-toothed, ovate, dark green leaves (unpleasant aroma when bruised). Leaves can be a skin irritant. Clusters (to 1 1/2"" across) of tiny lilac to purplish-pink flowers with yellow throats bloom profusely throughout the year in frost free areas. Flowers are attractive to bees and butterflies. In St. Louis, trailing lantana is grown as an annual, with flowers blooming from spring to fall frost. Flowers are attractive to bees and butterflies. Trailing lantana has escaped gardens and naturalized in parts of the southern U.S. including Florida, the Gulf Coast and southern California. It can spread invasively in frost free areas, but appears to be somewhat less invasive than its close relative Lantana camara. Genus name comes from the Latin name for viburnum. This species was reportedly discovered in Montevideo, Uruguay, hence the specific epithet.Genus name comes from the Latin name for Viburnum transferred to this genus.Specific epithet means of Montevideo, Uruguay.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Powdery mildew may occur, particularly if plants are grown in less than full sun locations. Leaf spot and stem rot may also occur. Watch for whiteflies and spider mites, particularly on overwintering plants.
","
Garden Uses
Flowering, shrubby, low-maintenance ground cover for frost-free areas. Good for erosion control on banks or hillsides. Where not winter hardy, it serves as an excellent annual for bedding or ground cover. Cascading stems make this a superior selection for hanging baskets, containers or growing along the tops of walls.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lantana trifolia is an upright tropical shrub that is grown as much for its fruit as for its flowers. it is not as commonly grown as Lantana camara.  Native to Mexico, the West Indies and both Central and South America, it is a frost-tender perennial shrub that typically grows to 2-6’ tall. Often commonly called three-leaved lantana because its leaves usually appear in whorls of three. Leaves (to 4” long) are oblong to lance-shaped, toothed, rough-textured and dark green. Tiny 5-lobed flowers in dense flattened hemispherical clusters (to 2” diameter) bloom summer to fall. Flower color is typically lavender, but may also be closer to pink or white. Flowers are attractive to butterflies. As the flowers fade, the flowering spikes elongates to form popcorn-like spikes of lavender fruits, hence the sometimes common name of lavender popcorn for this species. Some gardeners believe the unique fruits have more ornamental attraction and interest than the flowers.Genus name comes from the Latin name for Viburnum transferred to this genus.Specific epithet means three-leaved.

Culture
Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun. Tolerates some light shade. Also tolerates some drought. Best performance occurs in cool, fertile, humusy soils in cool summer climates with good air circulation. Provide even moisture and regular fertilizer throughout the growing season. Avoid overhead watering to the extent possible. Plants spread by rhizomes and will easily self-seed to the point of being somewhat weedy and invasive.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lathyrus latifolius, commonly called everlasting pea, is a rhizomatous herbaceous long-lived perennial with trailing or climbing stems that produces attractive rose to white pea-like flowers over a long summer bloom. Although native to the Mediterranean (southern Europe and Northern Africa), everlasting pea has been cultivated in North America since the early 1700s, and has over time escaped gardens and widely naturalized throughout much of the United States and Canada (typically along roadsides, fencerows, waste areas, railroad right-of-ways and fields). It is now considered to be invasive in some areas. Broadly-winged plant stems clad with oval, medium green, 3-inch leaflets in pairs will ramble indefinitely along the ground (foliage to 4-8"" tall) or climb by tendrils up nearby vegetation or support structures to 6-9' tall. Showy flowers (each to 1"" across) in colors of rose, pink-purple or white bloom early summer to fall in racemes of 6-11 flowers. Flowers are not fragrant. Flowers give way to flattened, pea-like seed pods. Both pods and seeds are toxic if ingested. Additional common names for this species include perennial pea and wild sweet pea.Genus name comes from the Greek word lathyros for pea or pulse.Specific epithet means broad-leaved.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems Slugs and snails are attracted to young plants. Additional potential pests include aphids, pea moth and mites. Potential diseases include powdery mildew, gray mold, rust, black root rot and leaf spot.
","
Garden Uses
Plants will sprawl along the ground or twine onto support structures. Borders or cottage gardens. Ground cover for slopes and embankments. Trail over rocky areas. Climb on walls or fences. Containers.

Culture
Cool weather annual that is best grown in rich, humusy, medium moisture, well-drained soil in full sun. Tolerates some light shade. Compost may be incorporated into the growing area prior to planting. Best performance occurs in cool soils (soil mulch helps) in cool summer climates with good air circulation. Sweet pea can be a challenge to grow well in hot and humid summers where, as temperatures rise, plants will decline rapidly to the point where removal from the garden becomes necessary. Provide even moisture and regular fertilizer throughout the growing season. Avoid overhead watering to the extent possible. In St. Louis, start seed indoors about 6-8 weeks prior to last spring frost date to maximize bloom time. In warm winter areas, seed may be sown in fall or late fall for winter and spring bloom. Avoid planting sweet peas in the same location in consecutive years. Plants may be grown in bushy mounds or as climbers. Climbers need a support structure on which to grow (e.g., trellis net, fence, strings, stakes or bamboo pyramid). Deadhead spent flowers to prolong bloom. Propagate by seed.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lathyrus odoratus, commonly called sweet pea, is a bushy or climbing annual that features highly fragrant flowers (odoratus meaning fragrant) on winged stems clad with medium to dark green leaflets in pairs. Stems end in tendrils which enable plants to climb. As a vine, it will climb to 6-8’ in a single season. Without support, it grows in a bushy mound to 2.5’ tall. Fragrant keeled flowers bloom in clusters. In St. Louis, flowers will bloom well from spring to early summer before succumbing to hot temperatures. Further north in cool weather summers, bloom will continue throughout summer to fall. Species plants feature purple flowers, but numerous cultivars now provide a large variety of additional flower colors (pink, red, blue, lavender, purple, white and bicolor). Cultivars come in large, intermediate and dwarf sizes.Genus name comes from the Greek word lathyros for pea or pulse.Specific epithet means fragrant.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems Slugs and snails are attracted to young plants. Aphids may appear. Unlike edible vegetable peas (see Pisum sativum), sweet pea fruits are inedible and poisonous to humans.

","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Laurus nobilis, commonly called bay laurel, is native to the Mediterranean. It is a pyramidal, aromatic, evergreen tree or large shrub that grows to as much as 60’ tall, but is usually seen much smaller (10-30’ tall). For garden purposes, it is often pruned to 8’ tall or less. Leathery, thick, elliptic to oval, glossy dark green leaves (2-4” long) from this tree are commonly used as a culinary herb. Small yellowish green flowers bloom in spring. Trees are dioecious (separate male and female trees). Flowers on female plants, if pollinated, are followed by single-seeded purple-black berries. In ancient Greece, leaves of this tree were woven into wreaths to crown the victors of various contests.Genus name comes from the Latin name for the laurel or bay.Specific epithet means notable or excellent.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Watch for scale (particularly on indoor plants), mealybugs and spider mites. Some susceptibility to anthracnose and powdery mildew. For more information see: Problems Common to Many Indoor Plants
","
Garden Uses
Outdoors, it makes an interesting specimen for shady areas of the landscape including patios, herb gardens and woodland gardens. May be grown as a screen. Excellent houseplant.

Culture
Grow in average, dry to medium, well-drained, alkaline soil in full sun. English lavender can be difficult to grow in the St. Louis area, primarily because of winter stresses and high summer humidity. Well-drained soils are required, particularly in winter. Root rot commonly attacks plants grown in poorly drained soils. Prefers a light, sandy soil with somewhat low fertility. Remove faded flowers to promote continued bloom. Prune to shape in spring after new leaves appear. Prune back to 8” in spring every 3 years to control plant size and to promote robust, new growth. High summer humidity in the St. Louis area is not appreciated. To combat high humidity, consider using rock instead of organic mulch. English lavender has slightly better winter hardiness than lavandin (Lavandula x intermedia) for the St. Louis area, but still may appreciate a sheltered location and winter protection.

Noteworthy Characteristics
Lavandula angustifolia, commonly called English lavender, has been a mainstay of herb gardens for many years. Despite its common name, it is not in fact native to England, but comes primarily from the Mediterranean region. It was reportedly named English lavender because of its ability to grow well in the English climate. This “true lavender” is commercially planted for harvesting its oils for use in perfumes. Lavender flowers and foliage are also popular additions to sachets and potpourris. English lavender varieties are more often used for culinary purposes than other types of lavender. This is a semi-woody plant that typically grows to 1.5-3’. Narrow, gray-green leaves (to 2 1/2” long) on square stems. Purple flowers appear in terminal spikes in late spring to early summer. Both foliage and flowers are highly aromatic. Leaves are evergreen in warm winter climates.Genus name comes from the Latin word lavo meaning I wash in reference to a former use of the plant as an aromatic wash.Specific epithet means having narrow leaves.
","
Problems
Susceptible to leaf spot and root rot. Plants may not survive in winter if soils are not well-drained and/or if temperatures dip below zero degrees without protective snow cover.
","
Garden Uses
This is a versatile garden perennial that should be considered for a wide variety of uses and not just relegated to a corner of the herb garden. The flowers and green-gray leaves provide mid-summer color and contrast to the perennial border front, rock garden, herb garden or scented garden. Can be particularly effective when massed. Also effective as an edger or low hedge in some areas. Fragrant flowers may be dried and used in sachets and potpourris.

Culture
Biennial or annual that can be difficult to grow well in the St. Louis area because of its preference for summer climates with cool nights and moderate amounts of rain. It dislikes hot and humid summers. It is best grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade. For best results, purchase plants from local nurseries or start seed indoors 6-8 weeks before last spring frost date. Set plants out after last frost date. Taller plants may need staking or support. Deadhead spent flowers to extend bloom period. Plants may overwinter in the garden in USDA Zones 8-10. Plants may self-seed in some areas.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lavatera arborea, commonly called tree mallow, is a biennial that is often grown as an annual. It will bloom in the first year. It typically grows 3-6’ tall on thick, woody-based stems clad with velvety, 5 to 7 lobed, medium green leaves (to 9” long). Funnel-shaped, purple-pink, hibiscus-like flowers (to 2.5” diameter) appear in leafy racemes or axillary clusters from mid-summer to fall. Good cut flower. Synonymous with and sometimes called Malva dendromorpha.Genus name honors J.R. Lavater, 17th-century Swiss physician and naturalist in Zurich.Specific epithet means tree-like.
","
Problems
No serious insect or disease problems. Root rot, leaf spots and rust may occur. Watch for Japanese beetle.

Culture
Annual. Grow in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Appreciates some light afternoon shade in hot summer climates such as the St. Louis area. Sow seed directly in the garden in spring two weeks before the last frost date. For earlier bloom, start seed indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost date or purchase plants from local nurseries. Set plants out after last frost date. Taller plants may need staking or support. Deadhead spent flowers to extend bloom period. May self-seed in some areas. This annual can be difficult to grow well in the St. Louis area because it prefers summer climates with cool nights and moderate amounts of rain.
","
Noteworthy Characteristics
Lavatera trimestris, commonly called tree mallow, is an upright annual that grows in a shrubby form to 2-4’ tall. It is noted for its summer to early fall bloom of saucer-shaped, white to pink flowers (to 2-3” wide) that appear singly in the upper leaf axils. Rounded, medium green leaves (to 3” long) have heart-shaped bases and 3-7 shallow lobes. Good cut flower.Genus name honors J.R. Lavater, 17th-century Swiss physician and naturalist in Zurich.
